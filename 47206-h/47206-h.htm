<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The object of this work is to ascertain the part which
Drink has played in the individual and national life of
the English people. To this end, an inquiry is instituted
into the beverages which have been in use, the customs
in connection with their use, the drinking vessels in
vogue, the various efforts made to control or prohibit the
use, sale, manufacture, or importation of strong drink,
whether proceeding from Church, or State, or both: the
connection of the drink traffic with the revenue, together
with incidental notices of banquets, feasts, the pledging
of healths, and other relevant matter.</p>

<p>It must interest every thoughtful being to know how
our national life and national customs have come to be
what they are. They have not sprung up in a night like
a mushroom. They have been forming for ages. Each
day has contributed something. The great river of social
life, ever flowing onward to the ocean of eternity, has
been constantly fed by the tributaries of necessity, appetite,
fashion, fancy, vanity, caprice, and imitation. Man
is a bundle of habits and customs.</p>

<p>With some, it is true, life is mere routine, a round
of conventionalities; literally &lsquo;one day telleth another;&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
with others, each day is a reality, has its fresh plan, is
a rational item in the account of life. To these nothing
is without its meaning; there is a definiteness, a precision,
about its hours of action, of thought, of diversion, of
ministering to the bodily claims of sustenance by eating
and drinking. Around the latter, social life has fearfully
encircled itself. The world was, and still is,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;On hospitable thoughts intent.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>The latter days are but a repetition of the former.
&lsquo;As it was ... so shall it be also. They did eat, they
drank.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Social life is intimately connected with the social or
festive board; in short, with eating and drinking, because
these are a necessity of nature. Other customs and
habits may be fleeting, but men must eat, men must
drink. Food ministers not only to the principle of life,
but to that of brain force also. Thought is stimulated,
activity is excited, man becomes communicable. He
then seeks society and enjoys it. Thus has social intercourse
gathered round the social board. Eating and
drinking are two indispensable factors in dealing with
the history of a nation&rsquo;s social life. Adopting the adage
by way of accommodation, &lsquo;In vino veritas,&rsquo; truth is out
when wine is in, once know the entire history of a nation&rsquo;s
drinking, and you have important materials for gauging
that nation&rsquo;s social life.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, a division has been adopted of
the subject into periods, in some respects artificial so far
as the present inquiry is concerned. The Romano-British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
period has been selected as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus a quo</i>. It might
have been speculatively interesting to penetrate further
into the arcana of the past, to have inquired who were
the earliest inhabitants of this country? Were they
aborigines, natives of the soil, or were they colonists?
Had they an independent tribal existence, or were they
originally a part of that great Asiatic family who emigrated
into and peopled Western Europe, and to whom
the Romans gave the name of Gauls?</p>

<p>Had such an inquiry been relevant, the question
would have been of immense importance; for drawing, as
one must, considerably upon imagination in dealing with
any period not strictly historic, one must either regard
the primitive inhabitants as independent aborigines, and
accommodate their supplies to their wants, or, regarding
them as an offshoot from another nation, suppose them
to have carried with them the customs of their parent
tribe, and find the sought-for habits of the child in the
ascertained habits of the parent.</p>

<p>But we are concerned with fact; and must therefore
date from a period when facts, however meagre and involved,
are forthcoming.</p>

<p>A chapter of <i>Bibliography</i> is appended for the benefit
of any who might wish to prosecute a study, of which the
present effort is a mere outline.</p>

<p class="subheading" style="font-size:170%;">NINETEEN CENTURIES OF DRINK IN ENGLAND.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="subheading">ROMAN PERIOD.</p>


<p>Little is known of the manners and customs of our
island inhabitants before the Saxon period; hence, there
can be no wonder that all is obscure before the Roman
invasion. For the hints that have come to light we are
indebted to such foreign historians as wrote in the century
before the Christian era, the century of the invasion,
and the age immediately subsequent.</p>

<p>These hints, utterly meagre, but generally consistent,
are supplied by such writers before Christ as Diodorus
and Cæsar, and such historians of the first century as
Strabo, Dioscorides, and Pliny.</p>

<p>Diodorus (lib. v.) notes the simplicity in the manners
of the British, and their being satisfied with a frugal
sustenance, and avoiding the luxuries of wealth. He
further observes:&mdash;&lsquo;Their diet was simple; their food
consisted chiefly of milk and venison. Their ordinary
drink was water. Upon extraordinary occasions they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
drank a kind of fermented liquor made of barley, honey,
or apples, and when intoxicated never failed to quarrel,
like the ancient Thracians.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cæsar (<i>De Bell. Gall.</i> v.) observes that the inhabitants
of the interior do not sow grain, but live on
milk and flesh.</p>

<p>Strabo, whose description of Britain in his fourth
book is barren, and not apparently independent (for he
seems mainly to follow Cæsar), writes in the early part
of the first century (probably about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 18), that the
Britons had some slight notion of planting orchards.</p>

<p>Dioscorides, in the middle of the same century,
affirms that the Britons instead of wine use <i>curmi</i>, a
liquor made of barley. Pliny the Elder speaks of the
drinks in vogue in his time of the beer genus, variously
called <i>zythum</i>, <i>celia</i>, <i>cerea</i>, <i>Cereris vinum</i>, <i>curmi</i>, <i>cerevisia</i>.
These, he says (lib. xiv.), were known to the nations
inhabiting the <i>west of Europe</i>. He exclaims against the
wide-spread intemperance: &lsquo;The whole world is addicted
to drunkenness; the perverted ingenuity of man
has given even to water the power of intoxicating where
wine is not procurable. Western nations intoxicate
themselves by means of moistened grain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It is important to add that Tacitus asserts (<i>Vit.
Agricol.</i>) that the soil of this country abundantly produces
all fruits except the olive, the grape, and some
others which are indigenous to a warm climate.</p>

<p>Putting together these scattered allusions we gather,&mdash;(1)
that <i>wine</i> was unknown to the Britons before the
Roman conquest. It is absurd to suppose that a people
as simple as the Britons, and holding so little intercourse
with other nations, should as yet obtain from abroad
such an article of luxury as wine, or prepare it from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
fruit not a native of the soil. Indeed, it was only about
a century before the Roman invasion of England that
vines were cultivated to any extent in the Roman empire;
so scarce had wines been previously that the libations
to the gods were directed to be made with milk.</p>

<p>(2) That the inhabitants of the interior used no
intoxicant, unless possibly <i>metheglin</i>. The language of
Cæsar implies this. Above the borders of the southern
coast, which were inhabited by Belgæ, and by them cultivated,
there were few traces of civilisation. The midlanders
were unacquainted with agriculture, contenting
themselves with pasture; whilst the northerners depended
on the produce of the chase, or upon that which grew
spontaneously. And everywhere it is the same. The
earliest savage inhabitants of any district eat without
dressing what the earth produces without cultivation,
and drink water (<i>dwr</i>, ὕδωρ). Savage nature is simple
and uniform, whereas art and refinement are infinitely
various.</p>

<p>(3) That the southerners made some kind of intoxicant
from grain, from honey, and from apples.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of agriculture, <i>metheglin</i> was
the only strong drink known to our inhabitants, and it
was a favourite beverage with them long after they had
become acquainted with other drinks. The rearing of
bees became an important branch of industry; and we
shall find later on, that in the courts of the ancient
princes of Wales the mead-maker held an important
position in point of dignity.</p>

<p>Metheglin (Welsh <i>Meddyglyn</i>), also called <i>hydromel</i>
and <i>mead</i>, was a drink as universal as it was ancient.
Testimony is afforded to this by the Sanscrit <i>mathu</i>,
Greek μέθυ and μέλι, Latin <i>mel</i>, Saxon <i>medo</i> and <i>medu</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Danish <i>miod</i>, German <i>meth</i>. And here one must regret
to demur to the suggested derivation of Metheglin from
Matthew Glinn, who possessed a large stock of bees that
he wished to turn into gain. The modes of the manufacture
of this drink vary much in different countries.
In the times to which we refer, the principal ingredients
were rain-water and honey. Somewhat later it is described
as wine and honey sodden together.</p>

<p>After the introduction of agriculture, <i>ale</i> (called by
the Britons <i>kwrw</i> or <i>cwrw</i>) became a common drink.
An early writer thus describes its manufacture: &lsquo;The
grain is steeped in water and made to germinate; it is
then dried and ground; after which it is infused in a
certain quantity of water, which being fermented becomes
a pleasant, warming, strengthening, and intoxicating
liquor.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>Cider</i> became known to the Britons at an early date.
John Beale, a seventeenth-century authority on orchard
produce, thought <i>seider</i> to be a genuine British word;
but it is generally referred to the Greek σίκερα, which,
curiously enough, is rendered in Wycliffe&rsquo;s version of
the Bible, <i>sydyr</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;For he schal be gret before the Lord;
and he schal not drinke wyn ne sydyr.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Macpherson,
in his <i>Annals</i>, rightly says that cider extracted from
wild apples was early known to the British in common
with other Northern nations, whilst Whitaker (<i>History
of Manchester</i>) thinks that this beverage was introduced
by the Romans. The opinion entertained by some that
it was a Norman invention is entirely a mistake. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
principal cider districts of the present day are Herefordshire,
Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Monmouth,
Somerset, and Devon. Its medicinal qualities are
variously stated. Lord Bacon accounted it to promote
long life. Sir George Baker considered it a cure for
dropsy. On the other hand, Dr. Epps (<i>Journal of
Health and Disease</i>) speaks of dropsy and insanity as
common diseases in Herefordshire, and says it is easy
to understand how diseased kidneys are produced by
the acid in the cider, and how dropsy follows from these
diseased kidneys.</p>

<p>We next inquire what kind of <i>Inns</i> were known to
the Ancient Britons. During the time of the Druids
there was an order of people called <i>Beatachs</i>, <i>Brughnibhs</i>,
or keepers of open houses, established for the express
purpose of hospitality. These were pretty much of the
same character as the chaoultries in India, and the
caravanseries in the East. In Ireland, the <i>bruigh</i> was
a person provided with land and stock by the prince of
the territory, to keep beds, stabling, and such amusements
as backgammon boards. The character of these
houses was, as we shall find, vastly altered in Saxon
times, when their names, <i>Eala-hus</i>, <i>Win-hus</i>, &amp;c., sufficiently
betokened the rationale of their existence.</p>

<p>We have seen that wine was unknown in this country
before the Roman occupation. But the tide of emigration
soon set in from Rome to Britain. The new-comers
brought with them the arts and manufactures of their
own country. The importation of wines presented to
our islanders a new species of luxury. Evidently contrasting
the simple habits of her subjects with those of
the Roman invaders, Queen Boadicea (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 61), making
ready for battle, appeals in an impassioned speech to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the heart of her troops, in which she exclaims: &lsquo;To us,
every herb and root are food, every juice is our oil, and
water is our wine.&rsquo; For well-nigh three centuries of
Roman occupation, wine continued to be an import.
It remained for a Roman emperor to give permission
to the Britons to cultivate vines and to make wine.
The circumstances were these: The Emperor Domitian
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 81), in order to check the growth of intemperance,
issued an edict for the destruction of half the vineyards,
and prohibited any more planting of vines without
licence from the emperors. Probus acceded to the
imperial purple, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 276. This emperor, having conquered
Gaul, revoked the edict of Domitian, and allowed
the provinces to plant vines and make wine. Britain
was included in the licence. From that time the purple
grape twined around many a British homestead. But
whether it ever really thrived in our soil and climate is
more than conjectural. Pliny throws doubt upon the
whole subject.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Camden regards the boon as affording
shade rather than produce.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Still there is a chain of
evidence that for centuries vineyards were planted in
various districts, which would not have been the case
had they been a complete failure. Five centuries after
the edict of Probus, Bede testifies to their existence;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
whilst Holinshed, in the sixteenth century, writes:&mdash;&lsquo;that
wine did grow here, the old notes of tithes for wine that
yet remain, besides the records of sundry sutes commenced
in diverse ecclesiastical courts; ... also the
enclosed parcels almost in every abbeie yet called vineyards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
may be a notable witnesse. The Isle of Elie also
was in the first times of the Normans called <i>le ile des
vignes</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Nor can we wonder at the efforts to establish
the grape as a native production when we consider the
almost universal attachment to the fruit in one or other
of its forms. If mead was in general demand, still more
so was wine. The common appetite found fitting expression
in a common nomenclature, and we find the
names given to wine in every country bearing a striking
similarity. Compare the English <i>wine</i> with the Gaelic
<i>fion</i>, the French <i>vin</i>, Italian <i>vino</i>, Welsh <i>gwin</i>, Danish
<i>viin</i>, German <i>wein</i>, Latin <i>vinum</i>, Greek οἶνος, Hebrew
<i>yayin</i>, the root term conveying the notion, according to
some, of <i>boiling up</i>, <i>ferment</i>, whilst others refer it to the
Hebrew verb signifying <i>to press out</i>.</p>

<p>Whether an advantage or otherwise, to the Romans
undoubtedly we owe <i>signboards</i>. The <i>bush</i>, which was
for ages with us the sign of an inn, we owe immediately
to them. Our proverb, &lsquo;Good wine needs no bush,&rsquo; is
of course own child to the Latin &lsquo;<i>Vino vendibili suspensa
hedera non opus est</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Wine that will sell needs no advertisement.&rsquo;
Our sign of &lsquo;Two Jolly Brewers&rsquo; carrying a
tun slung on a long pole is the counterpart of a relic
from Pompeii representing two slaves carrying an amphora.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Again, our country owes to Roman influence the
national custom of toasting or health-drinking.</p>

<p>The present writer has observed elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that
among the Romans luxury was carried to unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
excess. Many were their forms of revelry; amongst
these were <i>comissationes</i>, or drinking bouts pure and
simple. At these no food was taken, save as a relish to
the wine. Specimens of their toasting formalities will
be found in several classical authors.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It were idle to imagine that the Britons were uninfluenced
by such marked features of social life. If
these customs had not been adopted by them before the
time of Agricola, it is certain that when that most diplomatic
of governors held sway here, he would teach the
<i>jeunesse dorée</i> to drink healths to the emperor, and to
toast the British belles of the hour in brimming bumpers.
Sensual banquets, with their attendant revelry, no less
than spacious baths and elegant villas, speedily became
as palatable to the new subjects as to their corrupt
masters.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Intemperance was no stranger to any rank of society.
Not even the imperial purple was stainless.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thus was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>the soil prepared for the seed so abundantly to be sown
when the Saxon, the Roman&rsquo;s successor, should incorporate
himself with our British population.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="subheading">SAXON PERIOD.</p>


<p>It is to the heroic songs of the day that we must at this
period mainly look for the history of manners and of
convivial life. The chieftains assembled on the mead-bench,
and were diverted by the literary genius of the
&lsquo;scóp&rsquo; or poet. Whether in the capacity of household
retainer or wandering minstrel, he commanded protection,
respect, and admiration. He was the popular
exponent of the fashion of the time, and from his
productions we can form a tolerable estimate of the
prodigious part which drink played in the social life of
the Anglo-Saxon. In this respect it is not too much to
say that we inherit from the Saxons a perfect legacy of
corruption; it is therefore with considerable qualification
that we can accept the eulogies passed upon our forefathers
by some historians, and notably by Sharon
Turner, who represents our Saxon ancestors as bringing
with them a superior domestic and moral character, as
well as new political, juridical, and intellectual blessings.</p>

<p>One record we have of the manners of the Saxons
before they occupied Britain; from it we are able to
gather what were their essentially individual usages, and
thus are able to draw a definite line between their native
customs and those derived after their settlement amongst
us from the Romanised Britons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>This poem is the romance of <i>Beowulf</i>, the oldest
specimen of Anglo-Saxon literature&mdash;indeed, the oldest
epic in any modern language.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The scene is laid in the
Cimbric Chersonese. A certain king, Hrothgar by
name, determined to build a palace, &lsquo;a great mead-hall.&rsquo;
In the neighbourhood lived a giant monster who
used to make nightly incursions upon the palace during
the ale-carouse; on one occasion killing thirty of its
inmates. Beowulf, the brother of Hrothgar, resolved to
deliver them from this scourge. With fifteen of his
followers he proceeded to his brother&rsquo;s palace. Hrothgar
and his retainers were found drinking their ale and
mead. The poem describes the visit:&mdash;&lsquo;There was a
bench cleared in the beer-hall.... The thane observed
his office. He that in his hand bare the twisted
ale-cup, he poured the bright, sweet liquor.&rsquo; Meanwhile
the bard strikes up; the queen enters the hall; she
serves the liquor, first presenting the cup to the king,
then to the guests. Thus do the festivities continue till
nightfall. Beowulf and his company sleep in the hall,
&lsquo;the wine-hall, the treasure house of men, studded with
vessels.&rsquo; The giant appeared in the night, and after a
struggle was slain by Beowulf. The next day there
were great rejoicings at the death of the monster. &lsquo;The
lay was sung, the song of the gleeman, the noise from
the benches grew loud; cupbearers gave the wine from
wondrous vessels.&rsquo; The queen again presented the cup
to the king and to Beowulf; the festivities were prolonged
into the night. Soon, however, was vengeance on
the track; the mother of the giant appeared at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>palace and carried off a counsellor of Hrothgar, one of
the &lsquo;beer-drunken heroes of the ale-wassail.&rsquo; Beowulf
is again the deliverer, and subsequently ascends the
throne of his brother. A sketch of early manners like
this, in the general dearth of documentary evidence, is
invaluable. It is an outline, but one we can readily
fill in.</p>

<p>From this same Cimbric peninsula came the Saxon
leader Hengist, whose feast in honour of the British
king Vortigern is familiar to every one, though it rests
mainly on the very questionable authority of Nennius.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This writer states that the Saxon chief prepared an
entertainment to which he invited the king, his officers,
&amp;c., having previously enjoined his daughter to serve
them so profusely with wine and ale that they might soon
become intoxicated. The plan succeeded; Vortigern
demanded the hand of the girl. The province of Kent
was the price paid. This account, as given by Nennius,
is supplemented by Geoffrey of Monmouth, a British
historian, or rather romancer, of the twelfth century.
The story is always worth repeating. He says<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that
when the feast was over, &lsquo;the young lady came out of
her chamber bearing a golden cup full of wine, with
which she approached the king, and making a low
courtesy, said to him: &ldquo;Lauerd king wacht heil!&rdquo; The
king, at the sight of the lady&rsquo;s face, was on a sudden
both surprised and inflamed with her beauty; and calling
to his interpreter, asked him what she said, and what
answer he should make her. &ldquo;She called you &lsquo;Lord
King,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the interpreter, &ldquo;and offered to drink your
health. Your answer to her must be, &lsquo;Drinc heil!&rsquo;&rdquo;
Vortigern accordingly answered, &ldquo;Drinc heil!&rdquo; and bade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>her drink; after which he took the cup from her hand,
kissed her, and drank himself. From that time to this
(says the chronicler) it has been the custom in Britain
that he who drinks to any one says, &ldquo;Wacht heil!&rdquo; and
he who pledges him answers, &ldquo;Drinc heil!&rdquo; Vortigern,
being now drunk with the variety of liquors, the devil
took this opportunity to enter into his heart, and to
make him in love with the damsel, so that he became
suitor to her father for her.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that drink was a prominent link in the
chain whereby Kent passed from British into Saxon
hands. If Nennius may be trusted, it played an equally
important part in the cession of East-Sex, South-Sex,
and Middle-Sex. The substance of the story as told
by this chronicler is, that Hengist proposed to ratify
a treaty of peace with the British king Vortigern, by a
feast to which he invited him and his nobles. He bade
his Saxons who feasted with them, at a given signal,
when the Britons were sufficiently inebriated, each to
draw his knife and kill his man. The plot succeeded.
Three hundred British nobles were slain in a state of intoxication,
while the captive king purchased his ransom
at the cost of the three above-mentioned provinces. The
Welsh bard evidently alludes to this in the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
When they bargained for Thanet, with such scanty discretion,<br />
With Hors and Hengys in their violent career,<br />
Their aggrandisement was to us disgraceful,<br />
After the consuming secret with the slaves at the confluent stream.<br />
Conceive the intoxication at the great banquet of mead;<br />
Conceive the deaths in the great hour of necessity.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>We can judge from the above incidents the kind of
influence which the Saxons would be likely to exercise
upon the Romanised Briton. Not that intemperance
was a new plant of Saxon setting, for we have already
found that the seed sown of Roman debauchery was
beginning to yield the rank crop of excess in every grade
of society. Ancient British poetry affords ample proof
of this indictment. One of the most important fragments
of ancient Cymric literature is <i>The Gododin</i> of
Aneurin, a poem of the sixth century, the first poem
printed in the Welsh Archæology. It recounts a mighty
patriotic struggle of the Britons under Mynyddawr with
the Teutonic settlers in the district, which may be loosely
described as lying between the Tees and Forth. The
ever-recurring subject in this poem is the intoxication
of the Britons from excessive drinking of mead before
the battle fought at Cattraeth. A few quotations will
suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The warriors marched to Cattraeth, full of words;<br />
Bright mead gave them pleasure, their bliss was their bane.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
The warriors marched to Cattraeth, full of mead;<br />
Drunken, but firm in array; great the shame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Just fate we deplore.</span><br />
For the sweetness of mead,<br />
In the day of our need,<br />
Is our bitterness; blunts all our arms for the strife;<br />
Is a friend to the lip and a foe to the life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
I drank the Mordei&rsquo;s wine and mead,<br />
I drank, and now for that I bleed.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Unquestionable allusion to this poem of Aneurin is
made in Owen Cyveilioc&rsquo;s <i>Hîrlas</i>, written in the twelfth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>century:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Hear how with their portion of mead, went with their Lord to Cattraeth,<br />
Faithful the purpose of their sharp weapons,<br />
The host of Mynydauc, to their fatal rest.<br />
</p>

<p>To the sixth century are also to be referred the
poems of Taliesin, which tell of the battles between the
Britons and Saxons. One is preserved which is commonly
called the <i>Mead Song</i>, which he wrote to obtain
Elphin&rsquo;s release from prison. It is thus rendered<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I will implore the Sovereign, Supreme in every region,<br />
The Being who supports the heavens, Lord of all space,<br />
The Being who made the waters, to every body good;<br />
The Being who sends every gift and prospers it,<br />
That Maelgwyn of Mona be inspired with mead, and cheer us with it<br />
From the mead horns&mdash;the foaming pure and shining liquor<br />
Which the bees provide, but do not enjoy.<br />
Mead distilled I praise&mdash;its eulogy is everywhere,<br />
Precious to the creature whom the earth maintains.<br />
God made it for man for his happiness;<br />
The fierce and the mute, both enjoy it.<br />
The Lord made both the wild and the gentle,<br />
And has given them clothing for ornament,<br />
And food and drink to last till judgment.<br />
<br />
I will implore the Sovereign, Supreme in the land of peace,<br />
To liberate Elphin from banishment,<br />
The man that gave me wine, ale, and mead,<br />
And the great princely steeds of gay appearance,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>And to me yet would give as usual:<br />
With the will of God, he would bestow from respect<br />
Innumerable festivities in the course of peace.<br />
Knight of Mead, relation of Elphin, distant be thy period of inaction.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><br />
</p>

<p>A satire is also preserved of the same Taliesin, upon
the wandering minstrels of his time. He imputes to
them all kinds of vice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In the night they carouse, in the day they sleep;<br />
Idle, they get food without labour;<br />
They hate the churches, but seek the liquor houses;<br />
From every gluttony they refrain not;<br />
Excesses of eating and drinking is what they desire.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Another early British poet, Llywarch Hên, who
flourished in both the sixth and seventh centuries,
affords further proof that strong drink, ale or mead,
was the one thing needful. In his elegy on Urien of
Reged we find&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
He was a shield to his country;<br />
His course was a wheel in battle.<br />
Better to me would be his life than his mead.<br />
</p>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
This hearth; no shout of heroes now adheres to it:<br />
More usual on its floor<br />
Was the mead; and the inebriated warriors.<br />
</p>

<p>And here we naturally pause to inquire whether it is
fair to gauge the habits of the day from extracts such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>these. May they not have been the heated effusions of
the moment? May not these bards have cast the
shadows of their own excited brains on all around?
Alas! the pages of contemporary history, and the censures
of the Church, too surely confirm the impressions
of the poet. Thus, Gildas, the British monk, writing
in the latter half of the sixth century (<i>Epist. De Excid.
Britann.</i>), laments (§ 21) that &lsquo;not only the laity, but
our Lord&rsquo;s own flock, and its shepherds, who ought to
have been an example to the people, slumbered away
their time in drunkenness, as if they had been dipped
in wine.&rsquo; Again (§ 83), &lsquo;Little do ye put in execution
that which the holy prophet Joel hath spoken in admonishment
of slothful priests, saying, Awake ye who
are drunk from your wine, and weep and bewail ye all,
who have drunk wine even to drunkenness, because joy
and delight are taken away from your mouths.&rsquo; And
once more (§ 109), &lsquo;These are the words, that with
apparent effect should be made good and approved&mdash;deacons
in like manner, that they should be not overgiven
to much wine.... And now, trembling truly to
make any longer stay on these matters, I can, for a
conclusion, affirm one thing certainly, which is, that all
these are changed into contrary actions, insomuch that
clerks are shameless and deceitful in their speeches,
given to drinking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Do we wonder that this state of things was condemned?
The British Church could no longer keep
silent. Decrees respecting intemperance were issued in
the Synod held by St. David (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 569), interesting as
the only legislative relic of the British Church upon this
subject; unless, as Mr. Bridgett remarks in his useful
little book, <i>The Discipline of Drink</i>, we admit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
monastic penance of St. Gildas the Wise (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 570): &lsquo;If
any monk through drinking too freely gets thick of
speech so that he cannot join in the psalmody, he is to
be deprived of his supper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The following are among the canons of St. David:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Priests about to minister in the temple of God and drinking
wine or strong drink through negligence, and not ignorance, must
do penance three days. If they have been warned, and despise,
then forty days.</p>

<p>(2) Those who get drunk through ignorance must do penance
fifteen days; if through negligence, forty days; if through contempt,
three quarantains.</p>

<p>(3) He who forces another to get drunk out of hospitality must
do penance as if he had got drunk himself.</p>

<p>(4) But he who out of hatred or wickedness, in order to disgrace
or mock at others, forces them to get drunk, if he has not already
sufficiently done penance, must do penance as a murderer of souls.</p></div>

<p>Enough has been adduced to prove that the lovers of
debauch among the Anglo-Saxons could have found no
uncongenial soil in Britain. But their settlement in
our island did not tend to any moral millennium. They
found matters bad; they made them ten times worse.
At meals, after meals, by day, by night, the brimming
tankard foamed. When all were satisfied with their
dinner, says the chronicler, they continued drinking till
the evening. Drinking was, in short, the occupation of
the after part of the day. A cut taken from the Anglo-Saxon
calendar<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> represents a drinking party. The lord
and the two principal guests are sitting at the high
seat, or daïs, drinking after dinner. The excess to which
they yielded at banquets may be illustrated from a fragment
of an Anglo-Saxon poem, entitled &lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; which
is thus translated<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
There were deep bowls<br />
Carried along the benches often,<br />
So likewise cups and pitchers<br />
Full to the people who were sitting on couches:<br />
The renowned shielded warriors<br />
Were fated, while they partook thereof....<br />
Then was Holofernes,<br />
The munificent patron of men,<br />
In the guest hall;<br />
He laughed and rioted,<br />
Made tumult and noise,<br />
That the children of men<br />
Might hear afar,<br />
How the stern one<br />
Stormed and shouted.<br />
Moody and drunk with mead,<br />
Thus this wicked man<br />
During the whole day<br />
His followers<br />
Drenched with wine,<br />
The haughty dispenser of treasure,<br />
Until they lay down intoxicated,<br />
He over-drenched all his followers<br />
Like as though they were struck with death,<br />
Exhausted of every good.<br />

<p>An important collection of Anglo-Saxon poetry is
still preserved under the title of the <i>Exeter Book</i>, the
original MS. of which is kept at Exeter: being a portion
of the gift of books to the Church at Exeter by Bishop
Leofric in the eleventh century. It is a medley of
legends, religious songs, apophthegms, riddles, &amp;c.
These riddles, commonly called <i>Symposii Ænigmata</i>,
were very popular among the Saxons, whether the
meaning of the title be &lsquo;Riddles composed by Symposius,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>or &lsquo;Nuts to crack after dinner.&rsquo; Two specimens
will suffice. The first, probably taken from the story
of Lot&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
There sat a man at his wine<br />
With his two wives,<br />
And his two sons,<br />
And his two daughters,<br />
Own sisters,<br />
And their two sons,<br />
Comely first-born children;<br />
The father was there<br />
Of each one<br />
Of the noble ones,<br />
With the uncle and the nephew:<br />
There were five in all<br />
Men and women<br />
Sitting there.<br />
</p>

<p>The second is a very ancient specimen of that kind
of ballad of which the modern <i>John Barleycorn</i> is the
anti-type:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
A part of the earth is<br />
Prepared beautifully,<br />
With the hardest,<br />
And with the sharpest,<br />
And with the grimmest<br />
Of the productions of men,<br />
Cut and ...<br />
Turned and dried,<br />
Bound and twisted,<br />
Bleached and awakened,<br />
Ornamented and poured out,<br />
Carried afar<br />
To the doors of people,<br />
It is joy in the inside<br />
Of living creatures,<br />
It knocks and slights<br />
Those, of whom before while alive<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>A long while<br />
It obeys the will,<br />
And expostulateth not,<br />
And then after death<br />
It takes upon it to judge,<br />
To talk variously.<br />
It is greatly to seek<br />
By the wisest man,<br />
What this creature is.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The principal drinks which the Saxons adopted were
wine, mead, ale, cider, and piment.</p>

<p>The permission granted by the Emperor Probus to
plant vines has already been mentioned, as well as the
testimony to their existence by the historian Bede. John
Bagford, a book collector and antiquary of the seventeenth
century, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have often thought, and am now fully persuaded, that the
planting of vines in the adjacent parts about this city was first of all
begun by the Romans, an industrious people, and famous for their
skill in agriculture and gardening, as may appear from their <i>rei
agrariæ scriptores</i>, as well as from Pliny and other authors. We
had a vineyard in East Smithfield, another in Hatton Garden
(which at this time is called Vine Street), and a third in St. Giles-in-the-Fields.
Many places in the country bear the name of the
<i>Vineyard</i> to this day, especially in the ancient monasteries, as
Canterbury, Ely, Abingdon, &amp;c., which were left as such by the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>But whatever amount of evidence be forthcoming
that vineyards existed in the time of the Saxons, though
there is no doubt that they were in the main attached to
the monasteries, still it is certain that wine was not a
common drink among them; but when introduced into
their feasts it usually led to intemperance. It may also
be added that Bede mentions <i>warm wine</i> as a drink.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>But their most common beverage was <i>mead</i>. The extent
to which this drink prevailed amongst them is curiously
indicated by the nature of the <i>fine</i> that was imposed
upon the members of their friendly societies whose conduct
was called in question. It appears that for seven
out of thirteen descriptions of offence, the members were
fined a quantity of honey, varying in measure with the
nature of the offence, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Any member calling another names was fined a <i>quart
of honey</i>.</p>

<p>For using abusive language to a non-member, <i>one
quart of honey</i>.</p>

<p>A knight for waylaying a man, a <i>sextarius of honey</i>.</p>

<p>For setting a trap for any person&rsquo;s injury, <i>a sextarius
of honey</i>.</p>

<p>Any member neglecting when deputed to fetch a
fellow-member who might have fallen sick, or died at a
distance from home, forfeited a <i>sextarius of honey</i>. And
so forth. No doubt this honey was turned into mead,
and drunk on the gala days of the society.</p>

<p>Of <i>ale</i> three kinds are mentioned at this time: viz.
clear ale, mild ale, and Welsh ale. Accordingly we find
the Abbot of Medeshamstede letting certain land to
Wulfrid upon this condition, that Wulfrid should each
year deliver into the minster, among other items, two
tuns full of pure ale and ten measures of Welsh ale, an
agreement at which, adds the Saxon Chronicle, the king,
archbishop, and several bishops were present. <i>Welsh ale</i>
is mentioned at a much earlier date in the laws of Ine.</p>

<p>It was stated in a former section that <i>cider</i> became
known to the Britons at an early date. The Anglo-Saxons
knew it under the name of <i>Æppelwin</i>. Its origin is not
fully substantiated. Africa has been suggested as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
birthplace, probably because the fathers SS. Augustine
and Tertullian mention it. St. Jerome, too, speaks of an
intoxicating drink made of the juice of apples.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Saxons drank <i>piment</i>, but not generally.
This was a mixture of acid wine, honey, sugar, and
spices. We find it mentioned in the romance of <i>Arthour
and Merlin</i>, in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
There was piment and claré,<br />
To heighe lordlinges and to meyne.<br />
</p>

<p>Piment and wine were both at this time imports.
Thus in a volume of Saxon dialogues (<i>Tib. A.</i> iii.), one
of the characters, a merchant, describes himself and his
occupation. To the question &lsquo;What do you bring us?&rsquo;
he replies, &lsquo;Skins, silks, costly gems, and gold; various
garments, pigment, wine, &amp;c.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of Saxon festivals none were more celebrated than
their <i>Jule</i> or <i>Yule</i> (to which corresponds our Christmas),
a strange combination of conviviality and religion. It
appears to be a Saxon adaptation of an ancient Celtic
festival. The Celts worshipped the sun. At the winter
solstice the people testified their joy that the &lsquo;greater
light&rsquo; had returned to this part of the heavens, by celebrating
a festival or sun-feast, which took its name from
<i>Heol</i>, <i>Hiaul</i>, <i>Houl</i>, dialectic varieties of the Celtic expression
for &lsquo;sun.&rsquo; The prefix of the article will account
for the Gothic forms <i>Gehul</i>, <i>Juul</i>, and hence again the
softened forms, <i>Jul</i>, <i>Yule</i>. Upon this heathen festival
the Christians engrafted their great festival, the anniversary
of the rising of the Sun of Righteousness upon
a dark world.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Before leaving this subject notice should be taken of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>the <i>grafol</i>, or rent, paid upon lands. It furnishes some
incidental details of the social life of our ancestors.
Upon a certain estate in Lincolnshire we find that the
following yearly rent was reserved:&mdash;(1) To the monastery,
two tuns of bright ale, two oxen fit for slaughter,
two <i>mittan</i>, or measures, of Welsh ale,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and six hundred
loaves. (2) To the abbot&rsquo;s private estate, one horse,
thirty shillings of silver, or half a pound, one night&rsquo;s
pastus, fifteen mittan of bright and five of Welsh ale,
fifteen sesters of mild ale.</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon guilds, or social confederations, were
associated with drink. Every member was compelled
to bring a certain amount of malt or honey. The fines
they imposed also imply that the materials of conviviality
were not forgotten.</p>

<p>Amidst such surroundings it is scarcely matter for
surprise that we occasionally read of profuseness in the
high places of the Church as well as the State. Some
of the leading ecclesiastics had been brought up in the
lap of plenty. Wilfrid (consecrated Archbishop of York,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 669) is described by his biographer, Eddius, as the
most luxurious prelate of his age, but it should be remembered
that he was the son of a Bernician noble,
taught in his childhood to serve the cup in the mead-hall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>His fame, however, for sanctity is abundantly
attested. He has been called the first patron of architecture
among the Anglo-Saxons. Hexham and Ripon owe
to him their sacred piles. At the dedication of the latter
was a disgraceful scene of riotous festivity in which the
kings Ecgfrid and Aelwin with the principal nobles were
engaged. Such a scene upon such an occasion would
now happily be impossible. And it is by comparisons of
this kind that one is able definitely to estimate the improvement
or retrogression of moral tone. It should be
added by way of extenuation that such festivities were
continuations of the heathen paganalia, were countenanced&mdash;indeed,
with certain modifications commanded&mdash;by
order of Gregory the Great (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 601), to Mellitus,
the abbot, who accompanied Augustine to England. His
words, as given by Bede (<i>Eccl. Hist.</i> i. 30), are&mdash;&lsquo;On the
day of dedication, or the birthday of holy martyrs, whose
relics are there deposited, let the people build themselves
booths of the boughs of trees, round about those churches
which have been turned to that use from temples, and
celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting.... For
there is no doubt that it is impossible to efface every
thing at once from their obdurate minds.&rsquo;</p>

renders it glutinous, heady, and soporiferous.&rsquo; Cf. Pliny, lib. xiv.: &lsquo;Est

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="subheading">SAXON PERIOD&mdash;<i>continued.</i></p>


<p>Amongst the kings who, in the seventh century, governed
parts of Anglia, Edwin stands out prominently as a
beacon of beneficent rule. Two stories concerning him
are treasured from childhood, viz. his conversion to
Christianity, through the bringing back to his recollection
a mysterious vision by Paulinus, and the speech of
the royal counsellor, who compared human life to the
flitting of a sparrow through a festal hall. But one of
his philanthropic measures is of special interest in the
present connection. Edwin had been by compulsion a
wanderer. He knew the trials of a fugitive&rsquo;s life. He
had experienced the hardships of long journeys on tedious
roads which lacked accommodation for travellers; so,
with a heart full of sympathy, he caused to be set up in
the highways stakes, and ladles chained to them, wherever
he had observed a pure spring. Bede remarks that he
carried a tufa before him; he deserves that it be never
displaced.</p>

<p>The entertaining of strangers seems in these times
to have fallen to the clergy: hence the constant injunction
to them to attend to hospitality. It is in this sense
that Mr. Soames is justified in saying (<i>Anglo-Saxon
Church</i>) that clergymen were in fact the innkeepers of
those ancient times. One of the Excerpts of Ecgbright
enjoins &lsquo;that bishops and priests have an house for the
entertainment of strangers, not far from the church.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be naturally expected that the Church should
have made some effort to stem the wide-spread inebriety
of the Saxon population. And such was the case. We
have on record an almost continuous series of ecclesiastical
canons, decrees, and anathemas bearing upon the
national intemperance. Theodore, seventh Archbishop
of Canterbury (668-693), decrees that if a Christian
layman drink to excess, he must do a fifteen days&rsquo; penance.
In the following century, Bede, in a letter to
Egbert, Archbishop of York, writes: &lsquo;It is commonly
reported of certain bishops that the way they serve
Christ is this&mdash;They have no one near them of any
religious spirit or continence, but only such as are given
to laughter, jokes, amusing stories, feasting, drunkenness,
and the other snares of a sensual life&mdash;men who feed
their belly with meats, rather than their souls with the
heavenly sacrifice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of the same century, Winfrid, Archbishop
of the Germans (upon whom the Pope conferred
the name of Boniface), writes to Cuthbert, Archbishop
of Canterbury: &lsquo;It is reported that in your dioceses the
vice of drunkenness is too frequent; so that not only
certain bishops do not hinder it, but they themselves
indulge in excess of drink, and force others to drink till
they are intoxicated. This is most certainly a great
crime for a servant of God to do or to have done, since
the ancient canons decree that a bishop or a priest given
to drink should either resign or be deposed. And Truth
itself has said: &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves lest at any
time your heart be overcharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness;&rdquo; and St. Paul, &ldquo;Be not drunk with wine
wherein is luxury;&rdquo; and the Prophet Isaias, &ldquo;Woe to you
that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>at
drunkenness.&rdquo; This is an evil peculiar to pagans, and
to our race. Neither the Franks, nor the Gauls, nor the
Lombards, nor the Romans, nor the Greeks commit it.
Let us then repress this iniquity by decrees of synods
and the prohibitions of the Scriptures, if we are able.
If we fail, at least, by avoiding and denouncing it, let us
clear our own souls from the blood of the reprobate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This great Anglo-Saxon missionary not only preached
but practised. His Benedictine monks he describes as
men of strict abstinence, who used neither flesh, wine,
nor strong drink.</p>

<p>The Excerptions of Ecgbright date about the middle
of this century. Johnson, <i>English Canons</i>, assigns them
to 740; Sir H. Spelman to 750.</p>

<p>Amongst these are several sayings and canons of the
fathers respecting intemperance. Thus (No. 14)&mdash;&lsquo;That
none who is numbered among the priests cherish the
vice of drunkenness; nor force others to be drunk by his
importunity.&rsquo; (No. 18)&mdash;&lsquo;That no priest go to eat or
drink in taverns.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the supplemental Excerptions of the same Ecgbright
(MS. marked K.2, in the CCCC. Library), we have
(No. 74) &lsquo;A canon of the fathers. If a bishop, or one in
orders, be an habitual drunkard, let him either desist or
be deposed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the same Excerpts, penal intoxication is defined&mdash;&lsquo;This
is drunkenness, when the state of the mind is
changed, the tongue stammers, the eyes are disturbed,
the head is giddy, the belly is swelled, and pain follows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 747 a council was convened by Cuthbert at
Cloves-hoo. The 9th canon bids priests &lsquo;by all means
take care, as becomes the ministers of God, that they do
not give to the seculars or monastics an example of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ridiculous
or wicked conversation; that is, by drunkenness,
love of filthy lucre, obscene talking, and the like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The 21st canon ordains &lsquo;that monastics and
ecclesiastics do not follow nor affect the vice of drunkenness,
but avoid it as deadly poison.... Nor let them
force others to drink intemperately, but let their entertainments
be cleanly and sober, not luxuries, ... and
that, unless some necessary infirmity compel them, they
do not, like common tipplers, help themselves or others
to drink, till the canonical, that is the ninth hour, be
fully come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Canon 20 enacts: &lsquo;Let not nunneries be places
of secret rendezvous for filthy talk, junketing, drunkenness,
and luxury, but habitations for such as live in
continence and sobriety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the year 793 Alcuin gave good advice to the
brethren at Jarrow: &lsquo;Absconditas comessationes et
furtivas ebrietates quasi foveam inferni vitate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of the Saxon drinks to which reference has been
made, viz. <i>piment</i>, seems to have been drunk to excess
in the eighth and ninth centuries. Piment was a fascinating
compound; it was in fact a liqueur. The word is
probably derived from <i>pigmentarii</i>, apothecaries who originally
prepared it. The most common varieties of it
were hippocras and clarry. In the year 817, the Council
of Aix-la-Chapelle forbad the use of piment to the
regular clergy, except on solemn festival days.</p>

<p>In the eighth century, taverns or ale-houses where
liquor was sold had been established, and very soon fell
into disrepute. Hence the injunction of Ecgbright that
no priest go to eat or drink at a tavern (<i>ceapealethelum</i>).</p>

<p>A good idea of the proportionate consumption of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
meats and drinks can be obtained from the sales and
gifts of provisions to the monasteries. For instance, as
has been already alluded to, we find from the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle that in the year 852, Ceolred, Abbot of
Medeshamstede (Peterborough), and the monks let to
Wulfred the land of Sempringham, on the condition that,
after his decease, the land should return to the minster,
and that Wulfred should give the land of Sleaford to
Medeshamstede, and each year should deliver into the
minster sixty loads of wood, twelve of coal, six of faggots,
and two tuns full of pure ale, and two beasts fit for
slaughter, and six hundred loaves, and ten measures of
Welsh ale.</p>

<p>But the regulations of the various monasteries widely
differed, as did the regulations of each monastery at
different periods. It would appear that at one time the
use of wine was prohibited in the monastic houses; thus,
in the year 738, wine was <i>permitted</i> to the monks of England
by a decree of Bishop Aidan, founder of Lindisfarne
monastery. Sometimes a large allowance was granted;
thus Ethelwold allowed his monastery a great bowl from
which the <i>obbæ</i> of the monks were filled twice a day for
their dinner and supper. On their festivals he allowed
them at dinner a sextarium of mead between six of the
brethren, the same at supper between twelve of them.
On certain great feasts he gave them a measure of wine.</p>

<p>It will be necessary when dealing with the times of
King Edgar to advert at some length to Benedictine
Monachism, so we may postpone for the present an estimate
of conventual morality.</p>

<p>It is instructive to observe how a courageous and
virtuous soul may maintain its purity unsullied amidst
surroundings the most calculated to tarnish it. To live
in any century of Saxon times was a moral ordeal. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
possess certain tastes was to enhance the probation. The
life of King Alfred furnishes us with a lesson of the type
intended. His intellectual powers and tastes would have
strewn the path of most men with briars, if not precipitated
them into pitfalls. The love of music and poetry,
the concomitants of which were the ruin of so many
of his contemporaries, was conscientiously treasured by
him as a talent to be occupied. At a time when the
horn of mead circulated at a festival as freely as the
harp; at a time when the song of the Northmen too
often became the pretext for intoxication and its kindred
vices, Alfred was seeking wisdom from its true source;
his life was an embodiment of temperance, soberness,
and chastity. Many of his renderings of the Roman
philosopher Boethius, whose work, <i>De Consolatione
Philosophiæ</i>, he translated, or rather paraphrased, display
his own sentiments on such matters. In transmitting
them, he has transmitted himself. In some cases
the thoughts of his author are widely expanded. His
description, for instance, of the golden age: &lsquo;Oh! how
happy was the first age of this world, when every man
thought he had enough in the fruits of the earth.
There were no rich homes, nor various sweet dainties,
nor drinks. They required no expensive garments,
because there were none then; they saw no such things
nor heard of them. They cared not for luxury; but
they lived naturally and temperately. They always ate
but once a day, and that was in the evening. They ate
the fruits of trees and herbs. They drank no pure
wine. They knew not to mix liquor with their honey.
They required not silken clothing with varied colours.
They always slept out under the shade of trees. The
water of the clear spring they drank.&rsquo; Such is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
paraphrase of the king. The following is the language
of Boethius:&mdash;&lsquo;Too happy was the prior age, contented
with their faithful ploughs, nor lost in sluggish
luxury; it was accustomed to end its late fasts with
the ready acorn; nor knew how to confuse the present
of Bacchus with liquid honey; nor to mingle the bright
fleece of the Seres with the Tyrian poison. The grass
gave them healthful slumbers. The gliding river their
drink.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One more example may be given; the passage which
treats of tyrannical kings: &lsquo;If men should divest them
of their clothes, and withdraw from them their retinue
and their power, then might thou see that they be very
like some of their thegns that serve them, except that
they be worse. And if it was now to happen to them,
that their retinue was for a while taken away, and their
dress and their power, they would think that they were
brought into a prison, or were in bondage; because from
their excessive and unreasonable apparel, from their
sweetmeats, and from the various drinks of their cup,
the raging course of their luxury is excited, and would
very powerfully torment their minds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>What other king would thus have caricatured his
own order? What other man would have treated his
own surroundings with such persiflage? Surely here
he must have blindly adhered to the text of his author.
Is it so? The English of Boethius is, &lsquo;If from the
proud kings whom you see sitting on the lofty summit
of the throne ... any one should draw aside the
coverings of a vain dress, you would see the lord loaded
with strong chains within. For here greedy lust pours
venom on their hearts; here turbid anger, raising its
waves, lashes the mind; or sorrow wearies her captives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>,
or deceitful hope torments them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And yet the life of Alfred, so full of achievement as
well as purpose, was brought to a premature close. He
died at the age of fifty-two. The disease which had clung
to him in boyhood was replaced in manhood by another,
equally grievous. The protracted banquets, &lsquo;day and
night,&rsquo; of his nuptial festivities are assigned as the
probable cause. His biographer, Asser, remarks:&mdash;&lsquo;His
nuptials were honourably celebrated in Mercia,
among innumerable multitudes of people of both sexes;
and after continual feasts, both by night and by day, he
was immediately seized, in presence of all the people, by
sudden and overwhelming pain, as yet unknown to all
the physicians.&rsquo; We further learn that this complaint
attached to him for more than twenty years. If this
historian intends that the king&rsquo;s malady was the result
of debauchery, the whole tenor of his life is a flat contradiction.
The panegyric of the poet Thomson in his
<i>Seasons</i> is unimpeachable:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Whose hallow&rsquo;d name the virtues saint,</span><br />
And his own Muses love; the best of kings!<br />
</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to native vineyards. The
vine is mentioned in the laws of Alfred, &lsquo;<i>Si quis damnum
intulerit vineæ vel agro, vel alicui ejus terræ, compenset sicut
ejus illud æstimet</i>&rsquo; (cap. xxvi.). In the Saxon Calendar
there is a set of drawings illustrating the various employments
and pastimes of the year; the one attached to
the month of February gives some men pruning trees,
vines apparently among them. However, this proves
little, for the cuts appended to the months for gathering
in the vintage represent scenes of hawkings and boar-huntings;
the labours of the husbandmen being evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
subordinate. (A copy of this is inserted in Strutt&rsquo;s
<i>Horda</i>, vol. i. pl. xi.)</p>

<p>Something less than half a century from the death
of Alfred brings us to the tragical end of King Edmund
the Elder, for which unquestionably strong drink has to
answer. Amidst much variety of statement on the part
of the chroniclers, certain details seem fairly established.
The day of the occurrence was the anniversary or Mass-day
of St. Augustine (May 26), a day always observed
among the Anglo-Saxons whose apostle he was. A banquet
was held at which Leof, a noted outlaw, was
present. While the cup was circulating the king observed
the intruder. Heated with wine he started from
his seat, seized the outlaw, and felled him to the ground.
Leof grappled with the king, and with his concealed
dagger stabbed his royal antagonist, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 946. The
event is said to have happened at Pukelechirche (Pucklechurch),
in Gloucestershire, where was a palace of the
Saxon kings.</p>

<p>Hard indeed it was for a king to escape such surroundings
if even his disposition so prompted him. Of
this the narrative of King Edwy affords abundant proof.
On his coronation day, he retired from the revels of the
banquet (<i>linquens læta convivia</i>), to his own apartments,
much to the chagrin of the guests, who peremptorily
sent to fetch him back. Dunstan and Cynesius were
the agents employed. The king, probably loathing the
drunkenness of a Saxon debauch, declined to return,
upon which he was dragged by Dunstan from his seat
to the hall of revelry. We may wonder that so distinguished
an ecclesiastic should thus have urged the king
to a scene of intemperance, but it is not wholly inconsistent
with other details of his actions, of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
following narrative will serve as an illustration. King
Athelstan dined with his relative Ethelfleda. The royal
providers came to see if all was ready and suitable.
Having inspected all, they told her, &lsquo;you have plenty of
everything, provided your mead holds out.&rsquo; The king
came with numerous attendants. In the first salutation
the mead ran short. Dunstan&rsquo;s sagacity had foreseen
the event, and provided against it. Though the cupbearers,
as is the custom at royal feasts, were all the
day serving it up in cut horns and other vessels, the
liquor held out. This delighted the king, and much
credit redounded to Dunstan (Turn. <i>A. S.</i>, lib. vii. c.
iii. who cites MS. Cott. Cleop. B. 13).</p>

<p>But the very name of Dunstan at once conveys us to
the arcana of Monachism, and to the consideration of
some of its alleged vices. Our business is to confine
ourselves to the aspersions cast upon it on the score of
intemperance. Two cautions are here necessary. First,
in estimating the morality of the monks, it must be
remembered that in the tenth century the monastic
system had acquired a vast development, some of the
monasteries containing several hundred inmates, many
of whom were laymen. To these latter the intemperance
is attributed by some Roman Catholic writers,
whilst others do not hesitate to charge the monastic
orders with excesses. In the next place it was the interest
of Dunstan and his party to expose the irregularities
of the <i>secular</i> priests, whom he hated as much as
he despised, and whose ejection he compassed to make
room for the <i>regular</i> monks, his pets. The harangue of
King Edgar to the council convened by Dunstan may be
taken as the saint&rsquo;s indictment of the clergy, of whom
the king says:&mdash;&lsquo;They spend their days in diversions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>,
entertainments, drunkenness, and debauchery. Their
houses may be said to be so many sinks of lewdness.
There they pass the night in rioting and drunkenness.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Verily, King Edgar nearly anticipated by a thousand
years the legislation proposed by the United Kingdom
Alliance. Strutt says of him that, by the advice of
Dunstan, he put down many ale-houses, suffering only
one to exist in a village or small town; and he also
further ordained that pins or nails should be fastened
into the drinking-cups or horns, at stated distances, so
that whosoever should drink beyond these marks at one
draught should be liable to a severe punishment.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> We
shall have occasion to notice, when discussing the canons
of Anselm, how this very pin-drinking, devised as a
prohibitive measure, became a source of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Bad as was Edgar in some respects, we must clear
him from a charge preferred against him by Palgrave,
and to some extent by Lappenberg&mdash;that the vices of
the foreigners who were incorporating themselves received
encouragement from the king. Whatever countenance
he gave to the Danes, it was not through them
that the English became drunkards; that vice they had
been already schooled in, and independently. The
imputation, however, of these modern writers is readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>traceable to the chronicles of Henry of Huntingdon and
William of Malmesbury.</p>

<p>The Church certainly in this reign vied with the
throne in checking intemperance. Thus the following
canons occur in a code drawn up by Dunstan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(26) &lsquo;Let no drinking be allowed in the Church.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(28) &lsquo;Let men be very temperate at Church-wakes, and pray
earnestly, and suffer there no drinking or unseemliness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(57) &lsquo;Let Priests beware of drunkenness, and be diligent in
warning and correcting others in this matter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(58) &lsquo;Let no Priest be an ale-scop, nor in any wise act the
gleeman.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>In some penitential canons which Mr. Johnson
assigns to Archbishop Dunstan, with the date <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 963,
occur in canon vi. the words, &ldquo;I confess Intemperance
in eating and drinking, early and late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following injunctions occur in Elfric&rsquo;s canons:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(29) &lsquo;Let no Priest sottishly drink to Intemperance, nor force
others so to do, for he should be always in readiness if a child is to
be baptized, or a man to be houseled. And if nothing of this
should happen, yet he ought not to be drunk, for our Lord hath
forbidden drunkenness to His ministers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(30) &lsquo;Let no Priest drink <i>at taverns</i> as secular men do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(35) &lsquo;Nor ought men to drink or eat intemperately in God&rsquo;s house,
which is hallowed to this purpose, that the Body of God may be there
eaten with faith. Yet men often act so absurdly as to sit up by
night, and drink to madness within God&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But for them &lsquo;twere better that they<br />
In their beds lay,<br />
Than that they God angered,<br />
In that ghostly house.<br />
Let him who will watch,<br />
And honour God&rsquo;s saints,<br />
With stillness watch,<br />
And make no noise,<br />
But sing his prayers,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>As he best can;<br />
And let him who will drink,<br />
And idly make noise,<br />
Drink at his home,<br />
Not in the Lord&rsquo;s house,<br />
That he God dishonour not,<br />
To his own punishment.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>Other enactments may be discovered by the curious,
scattered about the pages of early synods, <i>e.g.</i> nunneries
were not to be houses of gossiping and drunkenness,
and beds of luxury, but of sober and pious livers. An
injunction this, evidently necessary, for Fosbroke
(<i>British Monachism</i>, p. 22) speaks of the nuns of
Coldingham as using oratories for feasting, drinking,
and gossiping. The same author introduces us to the
austere rule, as followed by the Britons, of Pachomius,
that singular institutor of the cenobitic life in Upper
Egypt in the fourth century. Abstinence seems to have
been in force; at any rate there was a clause forbidding
wine and <i>liquamen</i> (probably cider or perry) out of the
infirmary. The inmates were also prohibited <i>taverns</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
when necessity called them abroad. On such occasions
they were restricted to &lsquo;consecrated&rsquo; places. We have
already seen that taverns at this time were anything
but respectable, so ordinary travellers rarely used them;
hence the propriety of this inhibition.</p>

<p>The requirements of Fulgentius, the African anchorite
and bishop, were less severe. Among regulations of
diet we find: &lsquo;To have no more meat, drink, or clothes,
than the rule allowed.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not to eat or drink but at
stated times.&rsquo; &lsquo;No one to take any meat or drink before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>the abbot.&rsquo; The monastic rules of Dunstan were
certainly laxer. The ordinary times for drinking were
not too few, whilst special solemnities called for special
refreshment. In the latter category we become acquainted
with their <i>caritates</i> or charities&mdash;that is, cups
of wine, to drink which the monks were summoned by
sound of bell into the refectory, and which must have
been rendered peculiarly palatable by their listening to
the <i>collation</i>, which signified a reading of the lives of
the fathers or devout books; from which edification late
suppers have derived their name. These <i>charities</i> varied
in their composition: sometimes they consisted of beer,
sometimes a kind of honey <i>compôte</i>. Such <i>indulgences</i>
or allowances of drink were also called <i>misericord</i>.</p>

<p>In the great monasteries the <i>Poculum Caritatis</i> was
placed at the upper end of the refectory, on the abbot&rsquo;s
table. It was nothing more nor less than the old
wassail-bowl, the latter word obtaining its name from
the verbal formality adopted in health-drinking.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Enough has been said to correct the very common
impression that the Benedictine orders were self-mortifying
ascetics. Wealthy and learned, at times useful to
souls as well as bodies, their virtues have often been
overstated, whilst their vices no less frequently have
been palliated or denied.</p>

<p>The canons of King Edgar&rsquo;s reign furnish an almost
complete epitome of the manners of the time. His
twenty-eighth canon enjoined strict temperance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Church Wakes.</i></p>

<p>Much confusion has been displayed by various writers
in treating of the origin and rationale of these observances.
Sir H. Spelman saw in them such occasions of
gross intemperance, that he derives the word &lsquo;wake&rsquo; from
a Saxon word meaning <i>drunkenness</i>. But the derivation
is to be found in the fact that <i>wake</i> and <i>watch</i> are the
same words. The feast obtained its name from the
night spent in <i>watching&mdash;waking</i>. Mr. Bourne rightly
remarks<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that at the conversion of the Saxons by
Augustine, the heathen Paganalia were continued among
the converts, with certain regulations, by order of
Gregory the Great. This pope enjoined that on the
<i>day of dedication</i>, or the birthday of holy martyrs, whose
relics are there placed, the people should make to themselves
booths of the boughs of trees, round about those
very churches which had been the temples of idols, and
should observe a religious feast; that beasts be no
longer sacrificed to the devil, but for eating, and for
God&rsquo;s glory; that when the people were satisfied, they
should return thanks to the Giver of all good things.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Here is the origin of the wake. The abuse of the
original solemnity followed in accordance with the moral
law of gravitation. At first, all was decorum; the
people assembled at the church on the vigil or evening
before the saint&rsquo;s day, with burning candles, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>were wont devotionally to <i>wake</i> during the night. In
process of time &lsquo;the pepul fell to letcherie, and songs,
and daunses, with harping and piping, and also to
glotony and sinne; and so tourned the holyness to
cursydness; wherefore holy faders ordeyned the pepull
to leve that waking, and to fast the evyn. It is called
vigilia&mdash;that is, waking in English&mdash;and eveyn, for of
eveyn they were wont to come to churche.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We shall
find that in the reign of Edward III. Archbishop
Thoresby adopted drastic measures to remedy such like
abuses; whilst about the same time Chaucer, in his
<i>Ploughman&rsquo;s Tales</i>, censures the priests for caring more
for pastimes than for their duty. He says they were
expert</p>

<p class="blockquote">
At the wrestlynge, and at the <i>wake</i>,<br />
And chief chantours at the nale.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The end of all this was that they were suppressed,
and fairs were instituted on or near the saint&rsquo;s day, to
which the original name attaches in many villages.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the action of King Edgar was
favourable to the cause of temperance, and the perpetuation
of his name on a tavern sign in the city of Chester,
which, according to the legend, has existed ever since
his time, could only be regarded as a piece of irony,
were it not that it treasures the memory of the Saxon
king being rowed down the Dee, as some report, by eight
tributary kings.</p>

<p>An incident in the reign of Edward, the son and
successor of Edgar, is especially worthy of note as introducing
us to the origin of the custom called <i>pledging</i>
in drinking. Strutt (<i>Manners and Customs of the Ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Britons</i>), who evidently accepts the opinion of William
of Malmesbury, gives us the old form or ceremony of
pledging, as follows:&mdash;The person who was going to
drink asked the one of the company who sat next to
him whether he would <i>pledge</i> him, on which he, answering
that he would, held up his knife or sword to guard
him whilst he drank; for while a man is drinking
he necessarily is in an unguarded posture, exposed to
the treacherous stroke of some secret enemy. Thus a
<i>pledge</i> was a security for the safety of the person drinking.
This is said to have dated from the death of King
Edward (commonly called Edward the Martyr), <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 978,
who was murdered by the treachery of his step-mother
Elfrida. The motive for her act is well known. Of the
two claimants to the throne, Edward and Ethelred, she
had preferred the latter, her own son, to his elder half-brother,
her stepson. The story is told very differently
by the chroniclers Gaimer, William of Malmesbury, and
others; but the general purport is that Edward, when
out hunting, determined to visit Elfrida, who was living
with her son Ethelred at Corfe Castle. The queen went
out on his arrival, received him with hypocritical kindness,
and pressed him to alight, which he declined.
&lsquo;Then drink while you are on horseback,&rsquo; said the
queen. &lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;but first you will
drink to me.&rsquo; The butlers filled a horn of claret and
handed it to her. She drank the half of the filled
horn, and then handed it to the king. While he was
eagerly drinking from the cup presented, the dagger of
an attendant pierced him through. Dropping the cup,
he spurred his horse and fled. Soon he fainted through
loss of blood, and fell from his saddle. His feet hung
in the stirrups, by which he was dragged till life <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>was
extinct. It is only right to state that Mr. Brand (<i>Popular
Antiquities</i>) takes a different view of the meaning of
pledging. He imagines the phrase &lsquo;I pledge myself&rsquo; to
mean simply &lsquo;I follow your example.&rsquo; But while most
writers refer the custom to the Saxon incident of
Edward&rsquo;s death, Dr. Henry, in his <i>History of Great
Britain</i>, refers the custom to the fear of the Danes;
while Francis Wise, in his <i>Further Observations upon the
White Horse</i>, with eclectic caution remarks: &lsquo;The custom
of pledging healths, still prevalent among Englishmen,
is said to be owing to the Saxons&rsquo; mutual regard for each
other&rsquo;s safety, and as a caution against the treacherous
inhospitality of the Danes when they came to live in
peace with the natives.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">DANISH PERIOD.</p>


<p>It was at the close of this tenth century that the Danes
made their determined resolve to invade this kingdom.
Here again we shall see how closely the destinies of our
country have been associated with strong drink and its
surroundings. It was at a riotous banquet that Sweyne
vowed to kill or expel King Ethelred. The mode in which
a Scandinavian heir took possession of his heritage was
this: he gave a banquet, at which he drank to the
memory of the deceased, and then seated himself in the
daïs which the previous master of the house always occupied.
In conformity with this usage, Sweyne gave a
succession banquet. On the first day of the feast he
filled a horn and drank to his father&rsquo;s memory, making
at the same time a solemn vow that before three winters
had passed he would sail with a large army to England,
and either murder Ethelred or drive him out of the
country. After all the guests had drunk to King Harold&rsquo;s
memory, the horns were again filled and emptied in
honour of Christ. The third toast was given to Michael
the Archangel, and so on. There is much in this to
shock, and still more when we know that this custom
was perpetuated. But Mr. Mallet (<i>Northern Antiquities</i>,
p. 113), speaking of one of the religious ceremonies of
the North, says: &lsquo;They drank immoderately; the kings
and chief lords drank first, healths in honour of the
gods; every one drank afterwards, making some vow or
prayer to the god whom he named.&rsquo; Hence came that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
custom among the first Christians in Germany and the
North, of drinking to the health of our Saviour, the
Apostles, and the Saints: a custom which the Church
was often obliged to tolerate.</p>

<p>May we infer that retributive justice was at work,
and found its expression in the vow of Sweyne? The
character of Ethelred transpires in the official message
sent by the Danish settler Turkill (called also Turketul),
to Sweyne, inviting him to England. In this he lures
him by describing the country as rich and fertile, the
king a driveller, wholly given up to wine, &amp;c., hateful to
his own people, and contemptible to foreigners.</p>

<p>Under such a king we cannot wonder at the Danes
landing and plundering at will. Nor are we surprised,
knowing their character for excesses, that the Danes
should have acted as they did with barbarous atrocity
to one of the holiest saints whose name adorns the pages
of the Roman martyrology. St. Elphege had for some
few years been transferred from the see of Winchester
to the primacy. The Danes took Canterbury by storm,
and massacred the inhabitants, in spite of the earnest
protests of the archbishop. Nor did their vengeance
spare the mediator; after brutally ill-treating him they
confined him in irons in a filthy dungeon. After the
lapse of several months they offered him freedom upon
the payment of a ransom. This he stoutly refused,
predicting at the same time the downfall of their usurpation.
Thereupon the Danish chiefs, <i>drunken with
wine from the South</i>, hurled at their victim stones,
bones, and the skulls of oxen, and felled him to
the earth with the back of their battle-axes. One of his
converts mercifully released him from his misery on the
19th of April, 1012. The parish church of Greenw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ich,
named in his honour, marks the site of his martyrdom.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>But the deeds of blood with which drink is connected,
and which signalise this reign, are not yet all told. Two
of the noblest thanes of the Danish burghs were accused
of treachery to the king, at a grand political congress
held at Oxford in the year 1015. In the banquet chamber,
when, as Malmesbury states, they were drunk to excess,
they were slain by attendants prepared for the purpose,
with the assent of Ethelred. The horrible massacre of
the Danes by this king in 1002 is commonly thought
to have originated the holiday known as Hoke-day or
Hock-day. This is a mistake, as will be shown in treating
of this festivity in connection with the death of
Hardicanute.</p>

<p>Not only did strong drink minister to the conviviality of
the time, but it is evident that then, as ever, virtue was
conceived to attach to its use. The medical knowledge
of the time was almost confined to superstitious recipes;
and in these ale was often an ingredient, as was wine.
For the cure of sore eyes a paste of strawberry plants
and pepper was prescribed, to be diluted for use in <i>sweet
wine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Again, patients, while sitting in a medicated
bath, were to drink a decoction of betony and other herbs,
which were to be boiled in <i>Welsh ale</i>. To betony were
ascribed extraordinary virtues. Its fresh flowers are
said to have an intoxicating effect. Ale also formed an
ingredient in <i>religious charms</i>, <i>e.g.</i> &lsquo;Take thrift-grass,
yarrow, elehtre, betony, penny-grass, carruc, fane, fennel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>church-wort, Christmas-wort, lovage; make them into a
potion with clear ale, sing seven masses over the plants
daily,&rsquo; &amp;c. This was a recipe for a person labouring
under a disease caused by evil spirits, and was to be
administered in a church bell.</p>

<p>Ethelred&rsquo;s life scarcely harmonised with his laws. In
the year 1008, it is ordered, among other monitions, that
diabolic deeds be shunned, &lsquo;in gluttony and drunkenness.&rsquo;
Again, at the council of Enham, the 28th ordinance
cautions to the same effect. The Church also
spoke out boldly. Thus, in the 13th injunction of
Theodulf&rsquo;s Capitula, we read, &lsquo;It very greatly concerns
every mass-priest to guard himself against drunkenness;
and that he teach this to the people subject to him.
Mass-priests ought not to eat or drink at ale-houses.&rsquo;
One piece of the then legislation is worthy of attention
to-day; an ale-house was regarded as a privileged spot;
quarrels that arose <i>there</i> were more severely punished
than elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Whether or no the custom of pledging in drinking,
to which reference has already been made, originated in
consequence of the treacherous murder of Edward, certain
it is that the usage owed its revival and perpetuation
to the perfidious inhospitality of the Danes when they
gained a footing in England. Shakespeare alludes to
their dastardly practice of stabbing the English while
drinking, when he makes Apemantus say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">&lsquo;If I</span><br />
Were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,<br />
Lest they should spy my windpipe&rsquo;s dangerous notes:<br />
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><br />
</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>So haughty were the Danes at first that they would
not brook the English drinking in their presence unless
invited; indeed, they are said to have punished such an
act of supposed discourtesy with death. No wonder, then,
that our people would not venture to lift the cup until the
Danes had guaranteed their safety by a pledge.</p>

<p>The absurd custom of <i>toasting</i> received from the
Danes a mighty impulse. The drinking of healths was
an important element in their civil and religious banquets.
After their conversion to Christianity, the toast
of the saints took the place of that of their gods Odin
and Thor. Thus, to take an example from the life of St.
Wenceslaus, &lsquo;Taking the cup, he says with a loud voice,
&ldquo;Let us drink this in the name of the holy Archangel
Michael, begging and praying him to introduce our souls
into the peace of eternal exaltation.&rdquo;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> St. Olave, to
whom they owed their conversion, was another favourite
toast. St. John the Baptist was also thus commemorated.
The old expressions, <i>Drink-heil</i>, <i>Was-heil</i>, had given place
to <i>Pril-wril</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the precursors of the more modern <i>hob-nob</i>,
a term which now is used to denote close and familiar
friendship, but which once under the form of &lsquo;habbe or
nabbe&rsquo; denoted &lsquo;have or have not,&rsquo; and then became
narrowed in meaning to the convivial question whether a
person will <i>have</i> a glass to drink, or <i>not</i>, and so passed to
its present intention.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The chronicler, John Brompton, is right in saying,
&lsquo;by nature the Danes are mighty drinkers,&rsquo; but he errs
like the rest of them in saying that they left that quality as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>a perpetual inheritance to the English. The Saxons had
already done this. And it is a question whether in this
respect the Danes did not learn quite as much as they
taught. Iago was probably right in his dialogue with
Cassio, &lsquo;Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied
Hollander, drink, oh! are nothing to your English.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At
any rate, the Danish kings adopted the Saxon drinks&mdash;ale,
cider, mead, wine, morat, and pigment, and half the
Danish dynasty adopted them to their ruin.</p>

<p>The tragical end of Hardicanute is characteristic of
the age in which he lived, and was in keeping with his
life. A wedding-feast was given at Lamhithe (Lambeth)
by Osgod Clapa, a great lord, in celebration of the marriage
of his daughter Githa with Tovi Pruda, a Danish
nobleman; when, according to the Saxon Chronicle, the
king Harthacnut, as he stood at his drink, suddenly fell
to the earth with a terrible convulsion ... and after
that spake not one word. Others add that he fell in
the act of pledging the company in a huge bumper.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Smollett attributes his immediate end to over-eating
at this banquet, at the same time asserting that he was
particularly addicted to feasting and drinking, which he
indulged to abominable excess. To the same effect, Rapin
writes: &lsquo;All historians unanimously agree, he spent
whole days and nights in feasting and carousing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We cannot leave this short-reigned votary of the cup
without noticing the celebrated antiquarian hoax played
upon Richard Gough, the famous English antiquary of
the last century, by the fabrication of an inscription
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>purporting to record the death of the Saxon king, Hardicanute.
Steevens, as an act of revenge, obtained the
fragment of a chimney slab, and scratched upon it the
inscription in Anglo-Saxon letters, of which all I can
make is, &lsquo;H<i>e</i><span class="smcap">r</span><i>e</i> <i>H</i><span class="smcap">ardnut cyning gedronge vin hyrn</span>&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
&lsquo;here Harthcanute, king, drank wine horn,&rsquo; &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It was alleged to have been discovered in Kennington
Lane, where the palace of the monarch was said to
be situated, and the fatal drinking bout to have taken
place. Gough fell into the trap, exhibited the curiosity
to the Society of Antiquaries; Mr. Pegge, F.S.A., wrote
a paper on it; the society&rsquo;s draughtsman, Schnebbelie,
drew the inscription, and it was engraved in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>A curious festival is said to commemorate King Hardicanute&rsquo;s
death. John Rouse relates that the anniversary
of it was kept by the English as a holiday in his
time, four hundred years afterwards, and was called</p>

<p class="center"><i>Hock-day.</i></p>

<p>This festival in its various intentions is found
variously described as <i>hoke-day</i>, <i>hock-tide</i>, <i>hob-tide</i>, <i>hog&rsquo;s-tide</i>,
<i>hawkey</i>, <i>hockey</i>, <i>horkey</i>. As numerous as its names
are the derivations suggested for them. Thus, Dr. J.
Nott, in a note to Herrick&rsquo;s Ode, <i>The Hock-Cart</i>, speaks of
Hock-tide or <i>Heag-tide</i> as signifying high-tide, the height
of merriment (from <i>heag</i> or <i>heah</i>, high). Bryant (cited
in Nares&rsquo; <i>Glossary</i>) derives it from the German <i>hoch</i>, high.
Fosbroke (<i>Encyc. Antiq.</i>) speaks of the hocking on St.
Blaze&rsquo;s Day (Feb. 3) as taken from the women who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
torn by <i>hokes</i> and crotchets mentioned in his legend.
Verstegan (<i>Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</i>, 1634)
derives Hoc-tide from Heughtyde, which, he says,
means in the Netherlands a festival season. Sir H.
Spelman derives it from the German <i>hocken</i>, to put in
heaps: a derivation which would well suit the application
of the term to a harvest festival, as would the
German <i>hocke</i>, a heap of sheaves. But surely S. D.
Denne is right (<i>Hist. Particulars of Lambeth</i>) in deriving
it from <i>hochzeit</i>, wedding. As it was at the celebration
of the feast at the wedding of a Danish lord Canute
Pruden with Lady Pitha that Hardicanute died suddenly,
our ancestors had certainly sufficient grounds for distinguishing
the day of so happy an event by a word denoting
the wedding-feast, the wedding-day, the wedding
Tuesday. And if the justness of this conjecture shall
be allowed, may not the reason be discovered why the
women bore rule on this celebrity, for all will admit that
at a wedding the bride is the queen of the day.</p>

<p>If we refer the original of this festival to the eleventh
century, two occasions present themselves as claimants
for the honour. The first is the massacre of the Danes
under Ethelred, 1002. The old Coventry play of Hock-Tuesday
points to this date. This play, which was performed
before Queen Elizabeth in 1575, represented a
series of skirmishes between the English and Danes, in
which the latter, after two victories, were overcome, and
many led captive in triumph by the women. This play
the men of Coventry explained to be grounded on story,
and to be an old-established pageant. The custom may,
at any rate, be traced back to the thirteenth century.
Two objections are lodged against the reference of the
festival to this occurrence. In the first place it do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>es
seem a valid objection that a holiday could never have
been instituted to commemorate an event which afforded
matter rather for humiliation than for mirth and festivity.
The measure was unwise as it was inhuman, for Sweyn
terribly retaliated the next year, and inflicted upon the
country unparalleled misery and oppression. The second
objection is that of Henry of Huntingdon, who thinks
the dates cannot be made to fit, the massacre of the
Danes being on St. Brice&rsquo;s Day (Nov. 13), and the death
of Hardicanute June 8. But this difficulty would be
removed if we accepted the statement of Milner (<i>Hist.
Winchester</i>), that by an order of Ethelred, the sports
were transferred from November to the Monday in the
third week after Easter. And here the question opens
as to the <i>day of the week</i> upon which the feast was celebrated.
Dr. Plot (<i>Hist. Oxon.</i>) makes Monday the
principal day; on the other hand Tuesday is of general
acceptance: hence the special designations, Hock-Tuesday,
Binding-Tuesday. The fact is, that the Monday
was the vigil of the festival, and soon came to be kept in
common with the festival.</p>

<p>In Ellis&rsquo;s edition of Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i> will
be found a number of financial extracts of ancient
records referring to this feast&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in the parish registers
of St. Lawrence, Reading, in the year 1499, we find
recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Item, received of Hock money gaderyd of women,
xx<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Item, received of Hok money gaderyd of men,
iiij<i>s</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the St. Giles&rsquo;s parish register, under date 1535:
&lsquo;Hoc money gat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>heryd by the wyves, xiij<i>s</i>. ix<i>d</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the register of St. Mary&rsquo;s parish, 1559: &lsquo;Hoctyde
money, the men&rsquo;s gathering, iij<i>s</i>. The women&rsquo;s, xij<i>s</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>These hoc-tydes came to be scenes of revelry and
excess, causing their inhibition, in 1450, by the Bishop
of Worcester. This would simply apply to his own
diocese. They were still apparently in vogue in the
seventeenth century; thus Wyther<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Because that once a yeare</span><br />
They can affoord the poore some slender cheere,<br />
Observe their country feasts or common doles,<br />
And entertain their Christmass wassaile boles,<br />
Or els because that, for the Churche&rsquo;s good,<br />
They in defence of <i>Hock-tide</i> custome stood,<br />
A Whitsun-ale or some such goodly motion, &amp;c.<br />
</p>

<p>The custom has now long been abolished.</p>

<p>One feature of the social life of the Saxons is especially
interesting, in which we see the precursor of the modern
club. Voluntary associations, or <i>sodalitates</i>, were frequently
formed, the objects of which were variously,
protection, conviviality, and relief, both for soul and
body. Turner mentions a gild-scipe (<i>guild-ship</i>) at
Exeter, which purported to have been made for God&rsquo;s
love and their soul&rsquo;s need. The meetings were three
times a year, besides the holy-days after Easter. Every
member was to bring a certain quantity of malt, and
every cniht was to add a less quantity and some honey.
The fines of their own imposition imply that the
materials of conviviality were not forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Historians are for once unanimous in depicting the
general character of the Anglo-Saxons. Perhaps none
have painted it in blacker colours than Niebuhr. England,
he says, at the time of the Conquest was not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>effete with the drunkenness of crime, but with the crime
of drunkenness. The soldiery, as was natural, shared
in the general demoralisation. They laboured under a
greater deficiency than any which can result from the
want of weapons or of armour. Stout, well-fed, and
hale, the Anglo-Saxon when sober was fully a match for
any adversary who might be brought from the banks of
the Seine or the Loire. But they were addicted to
<i>debauchery</i>, and the wine-cup unnerves the stoutest arm.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
These were the troops who fortified themselves for the
fatal battle of Hastings with strong drink, and whose
cries of revelry resounded throughout the night. In
the quaint language of Fuller, &lsquo;The English, being
revelling before, had in the morning their brains arrested
for the arrearages of the indigested fumes of the former
night, and were no better than drunk when they came
to fight.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="subheading">NORMAN PERIOD.</p>


<p>We have now arrived at a period which introduces a
new element in the formation of our national social life.
Information respecting the habits of the Normans is
derivable not only from the chroniclers and historians
of the period, but from illuminated manuscripts, Anglo-Norman
fabliaux, the Bayeux tapestry, wood and other
carvings in sacred edifices, and even from chessmen.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The Norman historians insist that their countrymen
introduced greater sobriety, and are ever contrasting
their own morality with that of the Saxons to the disparagement
of the latter. William of Malmesbury speaks
of the Saxon nobility as given up to luxury and wantonness:
&lsquo;Drinking in parties was a universal practice,
in which occupation they passed entire nights as well
as days. The vices attendant on drunkenness, which
enervate the human mind, followed; hence it arose that
when they engaged William, more with rashness and
precipitate fury than military skill, they doomed themselves
and their country to slavery, by one, and that an
easy, victory.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Some of our later writers, making little
allowance for the national bias of Norman historians,
have even intensified this contrast. Thus, a modern
gleaner of English literature ventures to assert that the
brutal intemperance to which the Saxon was so prone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the Norman was free from. But scenes and incidents
which are ready to hand from Norman history must lead
us to modify such an opinion, or at any rate compel the
acknowledgment that the Normans very soon accommodated
themselves to the luxurious habits of the English.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Among the many conspiracies formed in the reign of
the first William, one at least was organised and developed
amidst the surroundings of excess, which cost
one of its noble projectors his life. The king had refused
to give his consent to the alliance by marriage of the
noble houses of Norfolk and Hereford. Opportunity
was taken of the king&rsquo;s absence from the country to
cement the union. A splendid banquet marked the
event. Among the many distinguished guests was Earl
Waltheof. Norfolk and Hereford, fearing the anger of
the king at their disobedience, formed a scheme to
depose him, and communicated the same to their guests
as soon as they saw them heated with wine. Waltheof,
who had well drunk, readily entered into the conspiracy;
but on the morrow, when the fumes of the drink were
dispersed, he repented his rash precipitation. Betaking
himself to Lanfranc he confessed all&mdash;he urged in extenuation
that his intemperance on the occasion had
prevented due reflection, and craved his mediation. All
was of no avail; he was apprehended and publicly beheaded.
Thus fell another of the long roll of victims to
drink.</p>

<p>A scene in lower life is depicted in the life of Hereward.
The hero in disguise is taken into King William&rsquo;s
kitchen to entertain the cooks. After dinner the wine
and ale were freely distributed, and the result was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
violent quarrel between the cooks and Hereward; the
former used the tridents and forks for weapons, while
he took the spit from the fire as a still more formidable
weapon of defence.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> On another occasion, when Hereward
secretly returned to his paternal home, which had
been taken possession of by a Norman intruder, he was
aroused in the middle of the night by sounds of boisterous
revelry and merriment. Stealthily approaching, he
saw the new lord of Brunne with his knights overcome
by deep potations, and enjoying the coarse songs and
brutal jests of a wandering minstrel.</p>

<p>An anecdote producing the same kind of impression
is told of Wulstan, Bishop of Worcester. In the time of
the Conqueror he was obliged to retain a large retinue
of men-at-arms through fear of the Danes. He would
not dine in private, but sat in his public hall with his
boisterous soldiers; and while they were drinking for
hours together at dinner, he would keep them company
to restrain them by his presence, pledging them, when
it came to his turn, in a tiny cup which he pretended to
taste, and in the midst of the din ruminating to himself
on the Psalms.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The illuminated manuscripts of the period abound
with illustrations of banquets, cupbearers, servants in
cellars, &amp;c., that suggest that the life then was not
more than either meat or drink. Rightly did John of
Salisbury remark that William would have deserved
more renown had he rather promulgated laws of temperance
to a nation which he would not have subdued
by arms had it not already been conquered by excess of
luxury.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>As late as the year 1070 we are reminded of the
intemperate propensity of the Danes. During that year
Sweyn visited this country. According to the Saxon
Chronicle they rifled the minster of Peterborough, put
out to sea with the spoil, and were arrested by a storm
which scattered their ships in all directions. Some of
the spoil, it appears, was brought back for safety, and
placed in the identical church. Then afterwards, continues
the Chronicle, &lsquo;through their carelessness and
through their drunkenness, on a certain night the
church and all that was within it was consumed with
fire. Thus was the minster of Peterborough burnt and
harried.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We have already enumerated the drinks adopted by
the Saxons and the Danes. They were principally ale,
wine, mead, cider, morat, and pigment. To these their
Norman successors added clarré, garhiofilac, and hippocras.
Wine was perhaps more used than formerly,
being chiefly imported from France; but ale and mead
were the common drinks. The innumerable entries in
Domesday Book show how large a proportion of the
productions of the country at this time consisted in
honey, which was used chiefly for the manufacture of
mead.</p>

<p>New <i>plantations of vines</i> seem to have been made
about the time of the Conquest, <i>e.g.</i> in the village of
Westminster, at Chenetone in Middlesex, Ware in
Hertfordshire, Hanten in Worcestershire. They are
measured by arpents (arpenni). Holeburne had its
vineyard, which came into the possession of the Bishops
of Ely, and subsequently gave its name to a street which
still exists. In Domesday Book (1086), among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> lands
of Suein in Essex, is an entry respecting an enclosure of
six arpents, which in good seasons (<i>si bene procedit</i>)
yielded twenty modii of wine.</p>

<p>Vineyards were attached to the greater abbeys, especially
in the south. This is easily accountable: (1) The
situation was in well sheltered valleys, (2) Many of the
monks were foreigners, and would know the best modes
of culture. Canterbury Church and St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Abbey had vineyards; so had Colton, St. Martin&rsquo;s, Chertham,
Brook, Hollingburn, and Halling, also Santlac
near Battle, and Windsor.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury, speaking of the fertility of
the Vale of Gloucester, and the spontaneous growth of
apple-trees, adds that <i>vineyards</i> were more abundant
there (<i>vinearum frequentia densior</i>) than in any other
district of England, the crops more abundant, and the
flavour superior. Moreover, the wines were very little
behind those of France. Mr. Barrington is clearly in
error (<i>Archæol.</i> iii. p. 77) in imagining that Malmesbury
intends orchards and cider, not vineyards and vines.
Surely he would have used the terms then in use for
these&mdash;viz. <i>pomeria</i> and <i>poma</i>. Indeed, in another passage,
Malmesbury, speaking of Thorney in the Isle of
Ely, says it was studded on the one side with apple-trees,
on the other covered with vines, which either trail
or are supported on poles. Knight remarks that this
question of the ancient growth of the vine in England
was the subject of a regular antiquarian passage-at-arms
in 1771, when the Hon. Daines Barrington entered the
lists to overthrow all the chroniclers and antiquaries
from Malmesbury to Pegge, and to prove that English
grapes were currants and that the vineyards of Domesday
Book were nothing but gardens. The Antiquarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Society inscribed the paper pellets shot on the occasion
as <i>The Vineyard Controversy</i>.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Windsor vines, William Lambarde
says that tithe of them was yielded in great plenty, &lsquo;accompts
have been made of the charges of planting the
vines that grew in the little park, as also of making the
wines, whereof some parts were spent in the household
and some sold for the king&rsquo;s profit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The list of religious houses to which vineyards, and
in many cases orchards likewise, were attached might
be indefinitely extended. There is a record of a vineyard
at St. Edmundsbury. The Saxon Chronicle states
that Martin, Abbot of Peterborough, planted another.
William Thorn, the monastic chronicler, writes that in
his abbey of Nordhome the vineyard was profitable and
famous. But notwithstanding all this, vine cultivation
in this country could never commercially compete with
France; and wine would have been to the mass of the
people an unattainable luxury, had not the ports of
Southampton and Sandwich been open to foreign exports.</p>

<p>A glance at the occupations of the servants will
afford some idea of the monastic life of the period; <i>e.g.</i>
in the time of William Rufus, the servants at Evesham
numbered five in the church, two in the infirmary, two
in the cellar, five in the kitchen, seven in the bakehouse,
four brewers, four menders, two in the bath, two shoe-makers,
two in the orchard, three gardeners, one at the
cloister gate, two at the great gate, five at the vineyard,
four who served the monks when they went out, four
fishermen, four in the abbot&rsquo;s chamber, three in the
hall.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>The name of the second William is one of the blots
on our regal history. He possessed, as is believed, his
father&rsquo;s vices without his virtues. Rapin observes that
William I. balanced his faults by a religious outside, a
great chastity, and a commendable temperance, but that
his son was neither religious, nor chaste, nor temperate;
whilst Malmesbury tells that he met with his tragical
end in the New Forest after he had soothed his cares
with a more than usual quantity of wine. In his reign
excess and sensuality prevailed amongst the nobility as
everywhere, unchecked and well-nigh unrebuked; the
voice even of the Primate being stifled for the moment
in the general profligacy, for, failing of the co-operation
of his suffragans, he quitted the kingdom, powerless to
cope with the depravity of the times.</p>

<p>An earnest desire on the part of Henry to curry
favour and popularity with the people was the cause
of the recall of the archbishop from his retirement at
Lyons. His efforts after a reformation of manners
were at once renewed. Among the canons of Anselm,
decreed at Westminster 1102, appears the following:&mdash;&lsquo;That
priests go not to drinking bouts, nor drink to
pegs (<i>ad pinnas</i>).&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It will be remembered that Archbishop
Dunstan had ordained that pins or nails should
be fastened into the drinking-cups at stated distances,
to prevent persons drinking beyond these marks. This
well intended provision had been terribly perverted, and
the pegs intended for the restriction of potations became
the provocatives of challenges to drink, and thus the
instruments of intemperance. This abuse, at first an
occasional sport, developed into a custom, and was called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><i>pin-drinking</i> or <i>pin-nicking</i>, and to it we owe the common
slang, &lsquo;<i>He is in a merry pin</i>.&rsquo; The cups thus
marked with pins, usually called <i>peg-tankards</i>, held two
quarts. Inside was a row of eight pegs, one above the
other from top to bottom; thus was there half a pint
between each peg. Each person in turn drank a peg-measure;
thus, while the capabilities of the persons
drinking were variable, the draughts were a fixed quantity,
so this inevitably gave rise to intemperance, more
especially as the tankards were renewed <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>The asceticism of Anselm met with the usual opposition.
One of Queen Matilda&rsquo;s letters to the Primate
contained a strong effort to dissuade him from such a
habit. She urged the comfortable advice to Timothy,
besides quoting Greek and Roman philosophers. Nor
would his views be palatable to many of the clergy,
who in this respect fell under the impeachment of the
chroniclers, whilst even the high places of the Church
were open to animadversion. The story is told of Ralph
Flambard, Bishop of Durham, that when lodged in the
White Tower he freed himself by stratagem. He provided
himself in prison with stores of wine. Among the
casks sent in was one which a confederate had filled, not
with wine, but with a coil of rope. The gaolers he plied
with drink, till overcome by it they left him free to act.
Thus did the Bishop make his escape.</p>

<p>From incidental notices we gather that strong drink
was used in profusion. Thus in the king&rsquo;s <i>progresses</i>,
when too often wholesale spoliation marked the action
of his retinue, we read of his followers burning provisions,
washing their horses&rsquo; feet with the ale or mead,
pouring the drink on the ground, or otherwise wasting it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>The tragedy of the reign was the loss of the &lsquo;Blanche
Nef.&rsquo; King Henry and his heir, Prince William, embarked
at Harfleur for England on the same night in
separate vessels. The prince, to make the passage
agreeable, took with him a number of the young nobility.
All was mirth and joviality. The prince ordered
three casks of wine to be given to the ship&rsquo;s crew. The
mariners were in consequence many of them intoxicated
when they put out to sea at nightfall. It was the great
desire of the prince to overtake his father, who had
sailed considerably earlier, and this emulation was one
of the causes of the disaster. The vessel, which was
sailing dangerously fast, struck upon a rock and began
to sink. The prince would, however, have been saved in
a boat that was lowered, but, putting back in response
to the cries of his half-sister, the boat sunk beneath the
load of the numbers who tried to avail themselves of its
succour. Of some three hundred passengers aboard the
White Ship, only one escaped to tell the mournful tale.
The king, it is said, was never after seen to laugh,
though he survived the dismal wreck about fifteen years.
Personally, he was a man of strictly regular habits.
Never was he known to be guilty of any excess in eating
or drinking, except that which cost him his life. A surfeit
of lampreys is said to have hastened his end; but for
this, all history endorses the testimony of the chronicler
that he was plain in his diet, rather satisfying the calls
of hunger than surfeiting himself by variety of delicacies.
He never drank but to allay thirst, execrating the least
departure from temperance both in himself and in those
about him.</p>

<p>Allusions abound in this Norman period to convivial
meetings o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>f the middle and lower classes in inns or
private houses. The miracles of St. Cuthbert, as related
by Reginald of Durham, give an insight to their private
life in the earlier part of the twelfth century. Thus, a
parishioner of Kellow, near Durham, is described as
passing the evening drinking with the parish priest.
Returning home late he was pursued by dogs, and
reaching his own house in terror, shut the door upon
them. He then mounted to a garret window to look at
his persecutors, when he was seized with madness, and
his family being roused carried him into the court and
bound him to the seats (<i>sedilia</i>). On another occasion,
a youth and his monastic teacher are represented as
going to a tavern, and passing the whole of the night in
drinking, till one of them becomes intoxicated, and cannot
be prevailed on to return home.</p>

<p>Hospitality in these troublous times was freely exercised.
The monasteries had their open guest-houses;
the burgesses in the towns were in the habit of receiving
strangers as private lodgers, in addition to the accommodation
afforded in the regular taverns (<i>hospitia</i>).</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott would be ready to defend the clergy,
as we found him shielding the Norman nobles from any
such imputation. The dialogue in <i>Ivanhoe</i> will be remembered.
&lsquo;An&rsquo; please, your reverence,&rsquo; said Dennet,
&lsquo;a drunken priest came to visit the sacristan at St. Edmund&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It does not please my reverence,&rsquo; answered
the Churchman, &lsquo;that there should be such an animal
as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that a layman
should so speak of him. Be mannerly, my friend, and
conclude the holy man only wrapped in meditation,
which makes the head dizzy and foot unsteady, as if
the stomach were filled with new wine. I have felt it
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>For reasons to be mentioned immediately, home
vineyards were beginning to be less cultivated, though
they were not by any means discontinued. William of
Malmesbury tells of a vineyard attached to his monastery,
which was first planted in the eleventh century by
a Greek monk who settled there. The Exchequer Rolls
contain a discharge of the sheriffs of Northampton and
Leicester, in the fifth year of Stephen, for certain expenses
incurred on account of the royal vineyard at
Rockingham.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the Duchy of Guienne (1152)
naturally led to an interchange of commodities between
England and France. Wine traffic with Bordeaux was
at once established; and from this time our statutes are
laden with ordinances concerning the importation of
French wine, most of which, in conformity to the mistaken
notions of political economy in those times, fix the
<i>maximum</i> of price for which they were to be sold.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">PLANTAGENET PERIOD.&mdash;HENRY II. TO THE DEATH OF
RICHARD I.</p>


<p>The period on which we now enter, called, in compliance
with usage, the <i>Plantagenet</i>, might for our present purpose
more strictly be named <i>The Light Wine Period</i>.
And it is instructive; and might have served for instruction
to certain of our legislators in the present reign,
who first tried beer (houses) to put down spirit drinking,
and then tried wine to put down spirits and beer. The
facts of English history were disregarded, and these
<i>remedial</i> expedients were adopted, in the light of which
the irony of the Spartans pales, who to put down
drunkenness made their slaves drunk, and then exhibited
them as hideous examples.</p>

<p>We have seen that the traffic of wines with Bordeaux
was brought about through the marriage of Henry II.
with Eleanor of Aquitaine. That &lsquo;great Provence dower,&rsquo;
as Dante calls it, was the secret of the new trade with
Guienne and Gascony, provinces which had both been
erected into the dukedom of Aquitaine in the preceding
century. The Normans were the great carriers. In the
centre of the vessels that brought home the produce of
the new English possessions in France were large fixed
tanks (<i>Pipæ gardæ</i>), and right well did the sailors understand
the process known as &lsquo;sucking the monkey,&rsquo; or, in
plain English, furtively drawing off the wine from its
receptacle in course of transit. And they must have had
plenty of choice, for amongst the wines imported <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>were
Muscadell, Malmsey, Rhenish, Dele, Stum, Wormwood,
Gascony, Alicant, Canary, Sack, Sherry, and Rumney.</p>

<p>At the very time that the English were enjoying the
wines of France, our French neighbours were reciprocally
appreciative. William FitzStephen, in his <i>Life of
Thomas à Becket</i>, states that when he went as chancellor
into France to negotiate a royal marriage, two of the
waggons which accompanied him were laden with beer
in iron-bound casks for presents to the French, &lsquo;who
admire that kind of drink, for it is wholesome, clear, of
the colour of wine, and of a better taste.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this period many writers refer the origin of</p>

<p class="center"><i>Distillation</i>.</p>

<p>And, as in many other cases, when the inventors are
unknown, the Arabians are at once accredited with the
discovery. The argument probably runs thus&mdash;<i>Alcohol</i>,
<i>alchymy</i>, <i>alchymist</i>, <i>alembic</i>, have all something in common;
moreover, they all begin with <i>al</i>, and <i>al</i> is the
Arabic article, <i>therefore</i> alcohol was invented by the
Arabians. So high an authority as Gibbon (<i>Decline and
Fall</i>) is of opinion that &lsquo;<i>they</i> first invented and named
the alembic for the purpose of distillation.&rsquo; Indeed, it
is the commonly received opinion that their visionary
hope of finding an elixir of immortal health led them to
the discovery of alcohol, and entailed upon mankind a
beverage which has proved to some a blessing, but to
millions a curse.</p>

<p>But the derivation of the words is the history of their
origin. <i>Alembic</i> is the Greek ἄμβιξ, a beaker, with the
Arabic prefix <i>al</i>, which is intensive. <i>Alcohol</i> is the
Hebrew <i>Kaal</i> (Chaldaic <i>cohal</i>), with the sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>me prefix, and
signifies something highly subtilised, pure spirit.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The
Arabians owed much to other countries; they were
rather restorers and improvers than inventors. They
formed the link which unites ancient and modern literature;
but their superstitious reverence for antiquity
checked originality of ideas and freedom of thought.
In respect of the discovery in question, it is certain that
the invention preceded the days of the Saracens. Pliny
very nearly described the process. Thus, he details the
mode of obtaining an artificial quicksilver by distillation;
and in another book (xv.), he speaks of the vapour
arising from boiling pitch being collected on fleeces of
wool spread over pots, and afterwards extracted from
them by expression. Galen, the famous medical writer
of the second century, speaks of distillation <i>per descensum</i>;
while Zosimus, a writer of the fifth century, has given
figures of a distilling apparatus which Borrichius has
copied in his <i>Hermetis et Ægyptiorum Chemicorum
Sapientia</i>.</p>

<p>The sobriety of the country can be tolerably gauged
from a comparison of such contemporary writers as John
of Salisbury, Giraldus Cambrensis, and Peter of Blois.
The former of these, in a letter to a friend, writes:&mdash;&lsquo;You
know that the constant habit of drinking has made
the English famous among all foreign nations.&rsquo; In
another letter, sent by him to this country: &lsquo;Both
nature and national customs make you drunkards. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>t
is a strife between Ceres and Bacchus. But, in the beer
which conquers, and reigns, and domineers with you,
Ceres prevails.&rsquo; Again, in his <i>Polycraticus</i>, he distinguishes
between vulgar feasts, when the mightiest
tippler is considered the best man, and polite feasts,
where sobriety becomes joyous, and plenty does not lead
to excess. Giraldus Cambrensis, Archdeacon of Brecknock
at the close of the twelfth century, describes a
dinner with the Prior of Canterbury where were a variety
of wines such as piment and claret, besides mead, &amp;c.
Of the Irish clergy, he says, &lsquo;you will not find one who,
after all his rigorous observance of fasts and prayer, will
not make up at night for the labours of the day, by
drinking wine and other liquors beyond all bounds of
decorum.&rsquo; Peter of Blois observes, in one of his letters:&mdash;&lsquo;When
you behold our barons and knights going on a
military expedition, you see their baggage horses loaded,
not with iron but wine, not with lances but cheeses, not
with swords but bottles, not with spears but spits. You
would imagine they were going to prepare a great feast,
rather than to make war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The greatest genius of the reign of Henry II. was
Walter Mapes, the king&rsquo;s chaplain, best known under
the names of &lsquo;Map,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;jovial archdeacon.&rsquo; This
last title is an anachronism, inasmuch as he was not
made Archdeacon of Oxford till the reign of Henry&rsquo;s son
Richard, when he was no longer an author. His powerful
satire was directed against the growing corruptions of
the Church. Never were abuses more sweepingly exposed
than in his famous <i>Apocalypse of Golias</i>&mdash;Bishop Golias
being an imaginary impersonation of ecclesiastical profligacy.
In estimating the personal qualifications of
Mapes to sit in judgment on his clerical brethren, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
should be remembered that he was the author of a celebrated
drinking ode in Leonine verse, which has a
singularly Bacchanalian ring about it. Camden alludes
to the author as one who filled England with his merriments,
and confessed his love to good liquor, with the
causes, in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of which the following, by Robert Harrison, is an
&lsquo;Imitation.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>I&rsquo;m fixed:&mdash;I&rsquo;ll in some tavern lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I return to dust;</span><br />

That the choice spirits of the skies<br />

May say, Ye gods, propitious smile!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here comes an honest fellow.</span><br />
<br />
My lamp of life &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&rsquo; kindle up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With spirits stout as Hector;</span><br />
Upon the flames of which I&rsquo;ll rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quaff celestial nectar.</span><br />
My lord invites me, and I starve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On water mix&rsquo;d with wine;</span><br />
But at <i>The Grapes</i>, I get it neat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never fail to shine.</span><br />

</p>

<p>Others have tried their hand at a translation. S. R.
Clarke (<i>Vestigia Anglicana</i>) thus renders the first
stanza:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Well, let me jovial in a tavern die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bring to my expiring lips the bowl,</span><br />
That choirs of angels, when they come, may cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heaven be propitious to the toper&rsquo;s soul.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The late Mr. Green gives the following version:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Die I must, but let me die drinking in an inn!<br />
Hold the wine-cup to my lips sparkling from the bin!<br />
So, when angels flutter down to take me from my sin,<br />
&lsquo;Ah, God have mercy on this sot,&rsquo; the cherubs will begin!<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><br />
</p>

<p>It only remains to add that this enigmatical character
well earned the title of &lsquo;the Anacreon of his age.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The habits of the king were abstemious, an example
which his sons disregarded. So dissolute and hot was
Geoffrey in his youth, remarks Giraldus, that he was
equally ensnared by allurements, and driven on to action
by stimulants. The &lsquo;nappy ale&rsquo; and the cup of
&lsquo;lambswool,&rsquo; well known to the readers of the pretty
ballad entitled &lsquo;King Henry II. and the Miller of
Mansfield,&rsquo; were the ruin of the royal prince, so prematurely
cut off. It might have been well for the three
brothers, Geoffrey, Richard, and John, had the sumptuary
laws of their father extended to drinks as well as
meats. But in forming an estimate of individuals much
is to be taken into account; and in the present instance,
in addition to youth and, perhaps, propensity, it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>be remembered that the surroundings of the court and
the conviviality of the times acted and reacted. Everything
that could was made to minister to appetite.
Religion itself was made subservient to the vulgar taste.
Its festivals were accommodated to the vulgar craving.
The feast of the Saviour&rsquo;s nativity was among the
primitive Christians ushered in by the display of calm
devotional feeling, unalloyed with the counterfeit of
sensual enjoyment, but soon it degenerated into a scene
of boisterous activity. Such it was during the Anglo-Saxon
period. Such it continued under the line of
Norman kings, with the one redeeming feature of the
assembling of the prelates and nobles of the realm for
deliberating upon the affairs of the country. As a relief,
however, to these grave deliberations the guests were
feasted with a series of banquets. The part played by
C&oelig;ur de Lion at such entertainments is thus alluded to
in one of the metrical romances of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Christmas is a time full honest;<br />
King Richard it honoured with great feast,<br />
All his clerks and barons<br />
Were set in their pavilions,<br />
And served with great plenty<br />
Of meat, and drink, and each dainty.<br />
</p>

<p>In the same way the festival of St. Martin was degraded.
The old calendars of the Church state, in the
order of the day: &lsquo;The Martinalia, a genial Feast;
wines are tasted of, and drawn from the lees; Bacchus in
the figure of Martin.&rsquo; While (says John Brady) it generally
obtained the title of the <i>second Bacchanal</i> among
old ecclesiastical writers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Altera Martinus dein Bacchanalia præbet;<br />
Quem colit anseribus populus multoque Lyæo.<br />
</p>

<p>A little old ballad tells the same tale, which
begins:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
It is the day of Martilmasse,<br />
Cuppes of ale should freelie passe.<br />
</p>

<p>Days spent in this medley of feast and deliberation
gave place to nights of revelry, at which masques and
mummings formed some of the features of the entertainments.
A continual round of revelry was thus
maintained during the whole of the twelve days forming
the feast of Yule, and seldom until the expiration of the
closing night&rsquo;s debauch did they return to a more sober
course. A capital insight into the manners of the times
of the first Richard is supplied by Sir Walter Scott in
his historical romance <i>Ivanhoe</i>. From it we gather the
forms of <i>pledging</i> then adopted: thus Cedric is represented
as addressing Sir Templar:&mdash;&lsquo;Pledge me in
a cup of wine, and fill another to the Abbot, while I
look back some thirty years to tell you another tale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;To the memory of the brave who fought&rsquo; at Northallerton!
&lsquo;Pledge me, my guests.&rsquo; After &lsquo;deep drinking&rsquo;
a further toast is proposed:&mdash;&lsquo;Knave, fill the goblets&mdash;To
the strong in arms, be their race or language what it
will.&rsquo; On another occasion we find the hermit bringing
forth &lsquo;two large drinking-cups, made out of the horn of
the urus, and hooped with silver. Having made this
goodly provision for washing down the supper, he
seemed to think no farther ceremonious scruple necessary
on his part; but filling both cups, and saying in
the Saxon fashion, &lsquo;<i>Waes Hael</i>, Sir sluggish knight!&rsquo; he
emptied his own at a draught. &lsquo;<i>Drink Hael</i>, Holy
Clerk of Copmanhurst!&rsquo; answered the warrior. Another
story is given in which Cedric welcomes King Richard
with the same salutation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>The heads of religious houses are probably caricatured
with truth. There is exquisite satire in the letter
which Conrad is made to read from Prior Aymer:&mdash;&lsquo;Aymer,
by divine grace, Prior of the Cistercian house
of St. Mary&rsquo;s of Jorvaulx, to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
a knight of the holy order of the Temple, wisheth health,
with the bounties of King Bacchus and my Lady of
Venus.... I trust to have my part when we make
merry together, as true brothers, not forgetting the wine
cup. For, what saith the text? <i>Vinum lætificat cor
hominis.</i>&rsquo; The capacity of Friar Tuck is gauged by
the king (chap. xli.) at &lsquo;a but of sack, a runlet of malvoisie,
and three hogsheads of ale, of the first strike.
If,&rsquo; says the king, &lsquo;that will not quench thy thirst,
thou must come to court, and be acquainted with my
butler.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Chronicles of St. Edmundsbury abound with
the irregularities of this time. For instance, we read
of a tournament held near St. Edmund, after which
eighty young men, sons of noblemen, were asked to
dine with the Abbot. After dinner, the Abbot retiring
to his chamber, they all arose and began to carol and
sing, sending into the town for wine, drinking, screeching,
depriving the Abbot and convent of sleep, and
refusing to desist at the command of the superior. When
the evening was come they broke open the town gates,
and went out. The Abbot solemnly excommunicated
them. Very few years after this (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1197) we find the
cellarer, at the same St. Edmundsbury, turned out for
drunkenness. The next year his successor committed a
crime, for which the Abbot restricted him to water. In
the case of another official,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> his goods were seized for
gross irregularities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>The clergy seem to have needed public admonition.
The eighteenth of Hubert Walter&rsquo;s Legislative Canons
at York enjoins: &lsquo;Because, according to the Word of
the Lord, if the priest offend he will cause the people to
offend; and a wicked priest is the ruin of the people;
therefore the eminence of their order requires that they
abstain from public bouts and taverns.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The tenth canon of the same archbishop, at Westminster,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1200, ordained &lsquo;that clerks go not to
taverns or drinking bouts, for from thence come quarrels,
and then laymen beat clergymen, and fall under the
Canon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When such was the condition of the clergy, it would
be vain to look for a high standard of morality among
the people. Richard of Devizes, the chronicler of the
acts of Richard I., exposes the intemperance of the king&rsquo;s
troops engaged in Palestine, and its influence upon their
allies. He remarks: &lsquo;The nations of the French and
English, so long as their resources lasted, no matter at
what cost, feasted every day in common sumptuously,
and, with deference to the French, to something more
than satiety; and <i>preserving ever the remarkable custom of
the English</i>, at the notes of clarions, or the clanging of
the trumpet or horn, applied themselves with due devotion
to drain the goblets to the dregs. The merchants
of the country, who brought the victuals into the camp,
unaccustomed to the wonderful consumption, could
hardly credit that what they saw was true, that a single
people, and that small in number, should consume three
times as much bread, and a hundred times as much
wine, as that on which many nations of the heathen, and
each of them innumerable, lived. The hand of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
deservedly fell upon these enervated soldiers.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the personal
habits of King Richard I. The immediate cause of his
death was an arrow which pierced his shoulder upon the
occasion of his laying siege to the castle of Limosin.
Some have blamed the unskilfulness of the surgeon
in attendance; others have said, the king himself by
his intemperance did not a little help to inflame the
wound.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The Edwardian romance, entitled &lsquo;Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion,&rsquo; contains abundant allusions to conviviality. In
the following quotation, the occurrence of the term
<i>costrel</i>, by which is intended an earthen or wooden flask,
is the occasion of a paragraph in Chaffer&rsquo;s valuable work
on pottery.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Now, steward, I warn thee,<br />
Buy us vessel great plente,<br />
Dishes, cuppes and saucers,<br />
Bowls, trays and platters,<br />
Vats, tuns, and costrel.<br />
</p>

<p>The same romance tells that it was a female minstrel,
an Englishwoman, who betrayed the knight-errant king
on his return from the Holy Land. It is worth quoting
as illustrative of minstrel life which in these times
formed so prominent a feature:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
When they had drunken well a fin,<br />
A minstralle com therein,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>And said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, wittily,<br />
Will ye have any minstrelsey?&rsquo;<br />
Richard bade that she should go.<br />
The minstralle took in mind,<br />
And saith, &lsquo;Ye are men unkind;<br />
And if I may, ye shall for-think<br />
Ye gave neither meat nor drink,<br />
For gentlemen should bede<br />
To minstrels that abandon yede,<br />
Of their meat, wine, and ale.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><br />
</p>

<p>In the reign of King John occurs</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Earliest Statute on the Foreign Wine Trade</i>.</p>

<p>It was enacted (1200) that the wines of Anjou should
not be sold for more than 24<i>s.</i> a tun, and that the wines
of Poitou should not be higher than 20<i>s.</i> The other
wines of France were limited to 25<i>s.</i> a tun, &lsquo;unless they
were so good as to induce any one to give for them two
marks or more.&rsquo; Twelve honest men in every town were
to superintend this assize. This ordinance, Holinshed
says, could not last long, for the merchants could not
bear it; and so they fell to, and sold white wine for
eightpence the gallon, and red, or claret, for sixpence.
The king claimed, out of every imported cargo, one tun
before the mast, and another behind it, under the name
of <i>prisa</i> or <i>prisa recta</i>, and officers were appointed to
collect and account for the same. From the entries of
this reign we discover that the principal wines then consumed
in England were&mdash;those of Anjou, chiefly white
and sweet; Gascon wine, wine of Saxony, and wine of
Auxerre, which came from the territory of the Duke of
Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction of these wines soon began to manifest
its effects. Roger de Hoveden, whose annals date
as far as the third year of John, says: &lsquo;By this means
the land was filled with drink and drinkers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That the English had a wide-spread fame for heavy
drinking we incidentally learn from an <i>on-dit</i> of Pope
Innocent III. When the case of the exemption of the
Abbey of Evesham from the Bishop of Worcester was
being argued before the pope, the bishop&rsquo;s counsel said,
&lsquo;Holy father, we have learnt in the schools, and this is
the opinion of our masters, that there is no prescription
against the rights of bishops.&rsquo; The pope replied, &lsquo;Certainly,
both you and your masters had drunk too much
English beer when you learnt this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>King John founded the Abbey of Beaulieu, which had
a famous vineyard. Possibly the imported wines did not
please the palate of the monks. Their standard may
have been that of a writer of the period who has given
the world an enumeration of the qualities of good wine,
which he says should be as &lsquo;clear as the tears of a penitent,
so that a man may see distinctly to the bottom of
his glass. Its colour should represent the greenness of a
buffalo&rsquo;s horn. When drunk, it should descend impetuously
like thunder, sweet-tasted as an almond, creeping
like a squirrel, leaping like a roebuck, strong, like the
building of a Cistercian monastery, glittering like a spark
of fire, subtle as the logic of the schools of Paris, delicate
as fine silk, and colder than crystal.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">PLANTAGENET PERIOD (<i>continued</i>).&mdash;JOHN, TO THE DEATH
OF EDWARD II.</p>


<p>A curious anecdote is told of King John in a book of
anecdote,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that upon his last visit to Nottingham he
called at the house of the mayor, and at the residence of
the priest of St. Mary&rsquo;s. Finding neither ale in the
cellar of one, nor bread in the cupboard of the other,
his majesty ordered every publican in the town to contribute
sixpennyworth of ale to the mayor yearly, and
that every baker should give a halfpenny loaf weekly to
the priest. This custom was continued in the time of
Blackner, the Nottingham historian, who wrote in 1815.
The king, like his brothers, was fond of drink. Sir
Walter in his <i>Ivanhoe</i>, while pleading for the general
manners of his subjects, admits that John, and those
who courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were
apt to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the trencher
and the goblet, and adds, &lsquo;indeed, it is well known that
his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and
new ale.&rsquo; D&rsquo;Aubigné, in his <i>History of the Reformation</i>,
referring to this king, says that he drank copiously of
cider, and died of drunkenness and fright. As his
authority for this, he gives in a footnote a Latin extract
from Matthew Paris to the effect that his sickness was
increased by his pernicious gluttony; he surfeited himself
with peaches and new cider, which greatly aggravated
the fever in him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>The action of the Church in this reign to suppress
intemperance brings us into contact with one in particular
of many kindred species of sources of excess, namely,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Scot Ales</i>.</p>

<p>First of all, what is the derivation of this compound
term? &lsquo;Scot&rsquo; (Saxon <i>sceat</i>, a part) signifies a portion
of money assessed or paid&mdash;hence any payment. Thus
&lsquo;scot-free&rsquo; means no payment. &lsquo;Ale&rsquo; signifies a merry
gathering, a feast, a merry-making. We find it variously
combined with prefixes which mostly explain themselves,
as bid-ale, bride-ale, church-ale, clerk-ale, Easter-ale,
give-ale, help-ale, lamb-ale, leet-ale, Midsummer-ale, scot-ale,
tithe-ale, weddyn-ale, Whitsun-ale. In each of these a
festival is denoted, at which ale was the predominant drink.
In this sense Ben Jonson uses the term in the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And all the neighbourhood, from old records<br />
Of antique proverbs, drawn from Whitsun lords,<br />
And their authorities at wakes and ales.<br />
</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And then satten some and songe at the <span class="smcap">ale</span>!<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Scot-ales accordingly denote a gathering at which the
company <i>share</i> the drinking expenses. But the first act
of legislation on the subject presents to us the expression
with a narrowed, but none the less definite, sense. In the
year 1213 King John in his absence had appointed Fitzpiers,
and Peter (the Bishop of Winchester), regents of
the kingdom. They summoned a council at St. Albans,
in which, among other matters, it was proclaimed to the
sheriffs, <i>foresters</i>, and others, as they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>loved their life
and limbs, not to make any violent extortions, nor dare
to injure any one, or to hold <i>scot-ales</i> anywhere in the
kingdom, as they had been wont to do. This legislation
was clearly levelled at the foresters, or officers of the
forests, who kept ale-houses and drew customers by intimidation.
Mr. Bridgett has clearly exposed their oppression.
He says, &lsquo;It will be remembered that royal forests,
or uncultivated lands, formed, at that time, no small
part of England, and that they were not subject to
common law. The king&rsquo;s officers took advantage of this
immunity to exercise great tyranny over the people,
and, previous to this period, sought to raise money by
setting up taverns and drinking assemblies, which the
country people were compelled to frequent for fear of
incurring the displeasure of their petty tyrants. Modes
of raising money, different in form, though similar in
their nature and consequences, are by no means unknown
to publicans at the present day; and labouring
men, in order to get hired, have sometimes to purchase
the good-will of the master of the beer or gin shop in
which workmen assemble and wages are paid. It will
be a happy day when a new Magna Charta shall rescue
the nation from the tyranny of the &ldquo;liquor interest,&rdquo;
whether it be that of the great brewers and distillers,
or of the petty vendors.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But scot-ales were by no means confined to the
foresters. The evil spread; the country was infested with
them, and of this the language of councils and synods
throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries is
ample evidence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>In these ecclesiastical prohibitions the word &lsquo;scotallum&rsquo;
is <i>scot-ale</i> dog-latinised, a nut which many a foreign
reader has failed to crack.</p>

<p>In the year 1220, Richard de Marisco, Bishop of
Durham, decreed: &lsquo;We forbid announcements of scot-ales
to be made by a priest or any one else in the church.
If priest or cleric do this, or take part in a scot-ale, he
will be punished canonically.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1223, Richard, Bishop of Sarum, orders, &lsquo;that
no announcement of scot-ales be made by laymen in
the church, and neither in the churches nor out of the
churches by priests or by clergymen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1230, Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, writes
to his archdeacons: &lsquo;We strictly command that you
prohibit in your synods and chapters those drinking
assemblies which are commonly called scot-ales; and
every year, in every church of your archdeaconries, this
prohibition must be several times made known; and if
any presume to violate this prohibition, canonically made,
you must admonish them canonically, and proceed against
them by ecclesiastical censures.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1237, Alexander Stavenby, Bishop of Coventry,
forbids under penalty any priest to go to a tavern, or to
keep a tavern or scot-ale.</p>

<p>In 1240, Walter of Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester,
decreed: &lsquo;We forbid the clergy to take part in those
drinking parties called scot-ales, or to keep taverns.
They must also deter their flocks from them, forbidding
by God&rsquo;s authority and ours the aforesaid scot-ales, and
other meetings for drinking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1255, Walter de Kirkham, Bishop of Durham,
wrote: &lsquo;We adjure all priests, by Him who lives for ever,
and all the ministers of the Church, especially those in
holy orders, that they be not drunkards, nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>keep taverns,
lest they die an eternal death; moreover, we forbid scot-ales
and games in sacred places.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1256, Giles of Bridport, Bishop of Salisbury,
decreed: &lsquo;We confirm the prohibition of scot-ales, which
has been made for the good both of souls and bodies;
and we command rectors, vicars, and other parochial
priests that, by frequent exhortations, they earnestly
induce their parishioners not rashly to violate the
prohibition.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For another century occasional decrees are issued
upon the same subject. One of the last admonitions
respecting scot-ales is to be found proceeding from the
Synod of Ely in 1364.</p>

<p>It will have been observed how vigorous was the
action of the Church in the reign of Henry III. But all
is not yet told. Archbishop Langton, in his Constitutions,
1222, decrees (canon 30) that archdeacons, deans,
rural deans, and priests abstain from immoderate eating
and drinking. Again (canon 47), that neither monks nor
canons regular spend time in eating or drinking, save at
the stated hours. They may by leave quench their thirst
in the refectory, but not indulge.</p>

<p>In the Constitutions of Archbishop Edmund, 1236,
the sixth canon forbids clergymen &lsquo;the ill practice by
which all that drink together are obliged to equal
draughts, and he carries away the credit who hath made
most drunk, and taken off the largest cups; therefore,
we forbid all forcing to drink.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bishop Grosseteste, to whom reference has lately been
made, turned his attention to the indirect as well as the
direct occasions of excess. He suppressed the May games
in his diocese of Lincoln, from which date the practices
of the day have gradually changed. The nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
festivities may be guessed from the fact that the Maypole
used to be called <i>ale-stake</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The action of the civil power was still limited in its
scope. Regulation of tariff was among the most prominent
of its efforts. Thus in the fifty-first year of
Henry III. (1266), it was enacted that when a quarter
of wheat is sold for 3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and a quarter of
barley for 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and a quarter of oats for 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, then
brewers in cities ought and may well afford to sell two
gallons of beer or ale for a penny; and out of cities to
sell three or four gallons for a penny. These regulations
are indicative that the manufacture of ale had become
of much consequence.</p>

<p>The quality of this drink was questionable. Matthew
Paris describes it as very weak.</p>

<p>Henry of Avranches, a Norman poet of the period,
has some coarse banter upon it. The lines as translated
begin thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Of this strange drink, so like the Stygian lake,<br />
Men call it <i>ale</i>, I know not what to make.<br />
</p>

<p>The criticism of the barons of Snowdon on London
ale counts for what it is worth, for nothing satisfied
them. Quartered at Islington, when they accompanied
Llewellyn to England, they could neither drink the wine
nor ale of London; neither mead nor Welsh ale could
be obtained; the English bread they refused to eat, and
all London could not afford milk enough for their daily
requirement. Hard to please they clearly were; nevertheless,
their complaint of the ale was justifiable. It
was made indiscriminately of barley, wheat, and oats,
sometimes of all combined. Without the hop, the ale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
must have been insipid. To remove its mawkish flatness,
they flavoured it with spices and other ingredients,
especially long pepper.</p>

<p>Home-made cider was evidently in repute, since we
find in this reign of Henry III. a gentleman holding his
manor in Norfolk on condition of supplying the king,
annually, at his exchequer, with two <i>mites</i> of wine, made
of pearmains (a species of apple).</p>

<p>Again, before the close of this thirteenth century,
Edward I. orders the Sheriff of Southamptonshire to
provide 400 quarters of wheat, and to convey the same
in good ships from Portsmouth to Winchelsea. Also to
put on board the said ships 200 tuns of cider.</p>

<p>Still, whatever were the merits of the home vineyards
and breweries, historians began to observe the growing
fondness for foreign wines. They accounted for it in
various ways: the listlessness of the people, home and
foreign wars, crusades, and that ever-recurring cause of
new phenomena, &lsquo;change of circumstances.&rsquo; So argues
Twyne, a man, according to history, of extraordinary
knowledge in the antiquities of England.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>A new custom of one penny for every tun, called
<i>guage</i>, was levied on all wines imported. From the
duty collected between a given date in 1272 and 1273,
at the ports of London, Portsmouth, Southampton,
and Sandwich, we find that there were imported
8,846 tuns, in addition to the <i>prisa</i> not liable to the
new impost.</p>

<p>Vinous preparations of a fancy character were much
in use. We read of an order for the delivery of two
tuns of white and one of red wine to make garhiofilac
and clarry for the king&rsquo;s table at York. The names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of some of these preparations are painfully significant.
Recipes are found for making <i>Bishop</i>, <i>Cardinal</i>,
<i>Pope</i>.</p>

<p>Whether in consequence of the royal statute upon
ale, or for some other reason, the first mention I can
find of the <i>Crown</i> as an inn sign occurs in this reign.
The tavern was in that part of Cheapside called,
after the inn, Crown Field. The king was evidently
a moderate, plain-living man; the only festivities
that he seemed to care for being those at Christmastide.</p>

<p>Inns, even at this time, were uncommon. In the
time of Edward I. Lord Berkeley&rsquo;s farmhouses were
used instead. Travellers would not only inquire for
hospitable persons, but even go to the king&rsquo;s palaces for
refreshment. Knights were known to lodge in barns.
But, though few in number, they had already proved a
nuisance. In the statutes for the regulation of the city
of London in the time of Edward I., it is stated that
&lsquo;divers persons do resort unto the city:&rsquo; some who had
been banished, or who had fled from their own country,
also foreigners and others, many of them suspicious
characters; and &lsquo;of these, some do become brokers,
hostlers, and innkeepers, within the city, as freely as
though they were good and lawful men of the franchise
of the city; and some do nothing but run up and down
through the streets, more by night than by day, and are
well attired in clothing and array, and have their food
of delicate meats and costly; neither do they use any
craft or merchandise; nor have they any lands or tenements
whereof to live, nor any friend to find them; and
through such persons many perils do often happen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the city.&rsquo; In addition to this, it was complained that
&lsquo;offenders, going about by night, do commonly resort
and have their meetings, and evil talk in taverns more
than elsewhere, and there do seek for shelter, lying in
wait and watching their time to do mischief.&rsquo; To do
away with this grievance, taverns were not allowed to
be opened for the sale of wine and ale after the tolling
of the curfew.</p>

<p>In the first year of Edward I.&rsquo;s reign was abolished
the old impost called <i>Prisage</i>, and in its place a duty
imposed of 2<i>s.</i> on every tun of wine imported. This
tax afterwards obtained the name of <i>Butlerage</i>, because
it was paid to the king&rsquo;s butler. It was abolished in
1311, in consequence of a petition urged upon Edward II.
for the redress of this and many other grievances.</p>

<p>It was stated above that ale was made of various
cereals. In 1302, barley-malt was rated at 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per
quarter, and from the cheapness of wheat the brewers
malted that grain also. The beer made from barley
was 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> a gallon, while that from wheat was only
1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, wheat being then only about 2<i>s.</i> the quarter.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This
caused a proclamation prohibiting the malting of wheat,
lest it should prevent the encouragement of its growth
for bread, and give the advantage to corn and other
grain.</p>

<p>The Church made herself heard during the long
reign of Edward I. in the Constitutions of Archbishop
Peckham, 1281, and in a synod at Exeter, 1287. In
the former, immoderate love of the pleasures of the
table, both in eating and drinking, was condemned. In
the latter, instructions were issued against the keeping
or frequenting of taverns by the priesthood; and su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ch
instructions were doubtless needed. Nor did the satirists
spare the clergy. One of these, writing at the close of
the thirteenth century, thus exposes a new order to
which is attached the name of &lsquo;Fair-Ease.&rsquo; Speaking
of the particulars in which this new order imitated
other orders, he adds: &lsquo;Of Beverly they have taken a
point, which shall be kept well and accurately; to drink
well at their meat, and then afterwards until supper;
and afterwards at the collation each must have a piece
of candle as long as the arm below the elbow, and as
long as there shall remain a morsel of the candle to
burn, the brethren must continue their drinking.&rsquo; And
again: &lsquo;A point they have taken from the Black Monks,
that they love drinking, forsooth, and are drunk every
day, for they do not know any other way of living....
Also it is provided that each brother drink before dinner
and after;&rsquo; and much more to the same effect.</p>

<p>At a visitation at St. Swithin&rsquo;s Priory at Winchester,
it appears that the monks claimed to have, among other
articles of luxury, &lsquo;vinum tam album quam rubeum,
claretum, medonem, burgurastrum.&rsquo; This was in the
year 1285. In the following year a benefactor grants to
the said convent &lsquo;unam pipam vini&rsquo; for their refection.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Another satire on the corruptions in the Church,
entitled &lsquo;The Land of Cockaigne,&rsquo; is assigned to the
latter part of the thirteenth century. The name signifies
&lsquo;kitchen-land.&rsquo; In this popular poem the land of
animal delights is painted as the happy land of monks
who had turned their backs upon the higher life to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>which they were devoted. A line or two will give an
idea.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In Cokaygne is met and drink<br />
Without care, how, and swink.<br />
The met is trie, the drink is clere,<br />
To none, russin, and sopper.<br />
</p>

<p>Which Professor Morley interprets:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In Cockaigne is meat and drink<br />
Without care, trouble, and toil.<br />
The meat is choice, the drink is clear,<br />
At dinner, draught, and supper,<br />
</p>

<p>and explains <i>russin</i> to be wine between meals, often
condemned of old; and connects with it the terms <i>rouse</i>
and <i>carouse</i>, which, says he, denote emptying of the
wine-cup, quoting, &lsquo;The queen <i>carouses</i> to thy fortune,
Hamlet.&rsquo; But the words are generally referred to <i>gar
aus</i>, all out. &lsquo;Russin,&rsquo; in the eastern counties, still
denotes drink at odd hours.</p>

<p>The household roll of the Countess of Leicester,
widow of Simon de Montfort, reveals some secrets of the
private life of the English towards the end of this thirteenth
century. Among the wines in use in that family,
<i>Gascon</i> and <i>Bastard</i> are prominent. Bastard was a
sweet Spanish wine, of which there were two sorts, white
and brown. Little is told in the roll of the price of
wine. Nine shillings and twopence was paid for twenty-two
gallons.</p>

<p>We are able to get a comparative view of the prices
of food at this time from a list of articles supplied by
his tenants when the Archbishop of Canterbury visited
his lands at Tarrings in Sussex, about 1277. The prices
seem very low.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The quantity of beer consumed in the household of
the countess was immense. On April 18, they brewed
five quarters of barley and four of oats; on the 25th
of the same month they bought 188 gallons of beer, and
on the 29th brewed again. Cider is mentioned once,
but was not especially relished. One tun was distributed
among 800 paupers. Cordials were in demand.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In the &lsquo;Squire of Low Degree,&rsquo; probably of early
fourteenth century date, the King of Hungary offers
to provide for his daughter wines from all manners of
countries&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Ye shall have Rumney and Malmesyne,<br />
Both Hippocras and Vernage wine,<br />
Mount Rose and wine of Greke,<br />
Both Algrade and despice eke,<br />
Antioche and Bastarde,<br />
Pyment also and garnarde;<br />
Wine of Greek and Muscadell,<br />
Both claré, pyment, and Rochell,<br />

And pottes of Osey sett you bye.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The constant mention about this time of Hippocras
(Ipocras, Ypocrasse) demands some notice. It was a
most favourite drink of the middle ages, a compound of
wine and aromatics. A curious recipe for it is given in
Pegge&rsquo;s <i>Form of Cury</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Ypocrasse for lords with gynger,
synamon, and graynes, sugour, and turesoll; and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>comyn pepull, gynger, canell, longe peper, and claryffyed
hony.&rsquo; Another recipe is found, much in vogue at
wedding festivals, &lsquo;introduced at the commencement of
the banquet, served hot; of so comforting and generous
a nature that the stomach would be at once put into
good temper.&rsquo; It was constantly served with comfits;
thus we find Elizabeth Woodville ordering up &lsquo;green
ginger, comfits, and ipocras.&rsquo; Katharine of Arragon
gave ipocras and comfits for the <i>voide</i>. In a satire upon
Wolsey, entitled, &lsquo;Why come ye not to the Court?&rsquo; we
find it in the company of sweetmeat&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Welcome, dame Simonia,<br />
With dame Castimergia,<br />
To drynke and for to eate,<br />
Swete ipocras, and swete meate.<br />
</p>

<p>It is strange that Pepys should have thought it unintoxicating.
Thus October 9, 1663, he went to Guildhall,
met there some friends; wine was offered, &lsquo;and
they drunk, I only drinking some hypocras, which do not
break my vowe, it being, to the best of my present
judgment, only a mixed compound drink, and not any
wine. If I am mistaken, God forgive me! But I hope
and do think I am not.&rsquo; It differed from clarry (claré),
wine mixed with <i>honey</i> and spice. Hence Fournier
mistakes in thinking that hippocras was wine spiced &lsquo;ou
édulcoré avec le miel&rsquo; (<i>Le Vieux-Neuf</i>, vol. ii.).</p>

<p>We hear very little of home vineyards at this time,
and, but for incidental allusions, it might be imagined
that the foreign trade was a monopoly. At the same
time, such allusions as we have are convincing that
native wine was a rarity. Lambarde states that the
Bishop of Rochester sent to King Edward II. when he
was at Bockingfield &lsquo;a present of his drinks, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>withal
both wines and grapes, <i>of his own growth</i>, in his vineyard
at Hallings.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The days when bishops were identified with the contents
of the cellar are buried in the sepulchre of the long
past, but we are now speaking of a time when a bishop&rsquo;s
induction to his see was often a disgrace to civilisation.
It is incredible, remarks Godwin, in his notice of the
installation of Bishop Stapleton to the See of Exeter
(1308), how many oxen, tuns of ale and wine, are said
to have been usually spent at this kind of solemnity.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that the duty on wine
was taken off in the year 1311. Four years later, a
proclamation was issued prohibiting the malting of
wheat.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In 1317, merchants who were not of the freedom
of the city were forbidden to retail wines or other
wares within its precincts or suburbs. Thus much for
the legislation of the reign.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the time must have been unbounded.
Stowe gives a curious instance, taken from
the accounts of the Earl of Lancaster&rsquo;s steward for the
year 1313. The items, which included 369 pipes of red
wine, amounted to 7,309<i>l.</i>, which is more than 20,000<i>l.</i>
of our money, and, making the due allowance for the
relative prices of food, would represent something like
100,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p>The terrible fate of Edward II. almost forbids hars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>h
criticism of his life. He was certainly fond of the
pleasures of the table, and is said to have given way
to intemperance. Had not the banqueting-room been
oftener employed than the council-chamber, opportunities
might not have occurred for the rebellion of
favourites, for which the festal board was answerable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">PLANTAGENET PERIOD (<i>continued</i>).&mdash;EDWARD III. TO
RICHARD III.</p>


<p>For a picture of the social life of the remainder of the
fourteenth century, we turn of necessity to one who was
the ornament of two of the most brilliant courts in the
annals of England, viz. those of Edward III. and his
successor, Richard II. We are for ever indebted to
him for exquisite pictures of genuine English life and
character in its infinite phases. And it may be here
noticed, as bearing upon our subject, that this</p>

<p class="center"><i>Geoffrey Chaucer</i></p>

<p>was the son of a wine merchant; that by circumstance
and ability he won for himself the patronage of Edward
III.; that he was made controller of the customs of
wine and wool in the port of London, and had a pitcher
of wine daily from the royal table. Towards the close
of the century he is supposed to have retired to pass
the calm evening of his active life at Woodstock, where
he is said to have composed his immortal <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>.</p>

<p>The prologue, whether written by Chaucer or not,
states that he was going to pass the night at the
Tabarde Inn, in Southwark, previous to setting out on
a pilgrimage to the shrine of Thomas à Becket at Canterbury.
A number of pilgrims, twenty-nine <i>sundry folk</i>,
meet at this hostelry in good fellowship. There they
sup together; after which &lsquo;mine hoste&rsquo; proposes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
they shall journey together to Canterbury; that, in
order to beguile the way, each shall tell a tale to and
fro, and whoever tells the best shall have a supper at
the expense of the rest; of course at his hostelry. The
company assent. &lsquo;Mine hoste&rsquo; is appointed judge and
reporter of the stories. The pilgrims, or characters composing
the social party, are, to all intents, an inventory
of English society as it existed at that day. We seem
actually to see the daily life of each reflected in the marvellous
mirror. Allusions to drink abound. Thus, in
the prologue, he describes a <i>Prioress</i>, and her delicacy of
manners at table, as becomes a gentlewoman:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Hire overlippè wiped she so clene,<br />
That in hire cuppe was no ferthing sene<br />
Of gresè, whan she dronken hadde hire draught.<br />
</p>

<p>He describes the <i>Frankelein</i> or country gentleman,
who was ambitious of showing his riches by the profusion
of his table, but whose hospitality often degenerated
into excess.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
For he was Epicure&rsquo;s owen sone,<br />
That held opinion, that plein delit<br />
Was veraily felicite parfite.<br />
<br />
An householder, and that a grete was he;<br />
Seint Julian he was in his contree.<br />
His brede, his ale, was alway after on;<br />
A better envyned man was no wher non.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke.<br />
</p>

<p>London ale must have been then in repute, for
among the accomplishments of one of the party who was
less a pilgrim than a cook, it is noted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Well coude he knowe a draught of London ale.<br />
</p>

<p>Thomas Tyrwhitt, in a note on this line, remarks,
&lsquo;Whether this was a different sort of ale from that of
the provinces, or only better made, I know not; but it
appears to have been in request about a century after
Chaucer. In the account of the feast of Archbishop
Warham, in 1504, we find that London ale was higher
priced than Kentish by 5<i>s.</i> a barrel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The true British sailor of Chaucer&rsquo;s time exhibited
nearly the same strong traits as our own brave tars.
That his conscience was not too finely drawn appears in
his conduct at Bordeaux, where he drew full many a
draught of wine while the chapman slept:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The hote sommer hadde made his hewe al broun,<br />
And certainly he was a good felaw.<br />
Full many a draught of win he hadde draw<br />
From Burdeux ward, while that the chapman slepe;<br />
Of nice conscience toke he no kepe.<br />
</p>

<p>The description of the Sompnour, or Ecclesiastical
Apparitor, is not an inviting one. Church officials <i>temp.</i>
Chaucer were not all they might have been.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
A sompnour was ther with us in that place,             <span class="linenum">625</span><br />
That hadde a fire-red cherubinnés face,<br />
For sausefleme he was, with eyen narwe;<br />
As hote he was, and likerous as a sparwe,<br />
With scalled browes blake, and pilled berd:<br />
Of his visage children were sore aferd.                <span class="linenum">630</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />

And for to drinke strong win as rede as blood.<br />
Than wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood.<br />
And whan that he wel dronken had the win,<br />
Than wold he speken no word but Latin.                 <span class="linenum">640</span><br />
A fewe termes coude he, two or three,<br />
That he had lerned out of som decree;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>No wonder is, he herd it all the day.<br />
And eke ye knowen wel, how that a jay<br />
Can clepen watte, as wel as can the pope.              <span class="linenum">645</span><br />
But who so wolde in other thing him grope,<br />
Than hadde he spent all his philosophie,<br />
Ay, <i>Quæstio quid juris</i>, wolde he crie.          <span class="linenum">648</span><br />
</p>

<p>Among others of the Sompnour&rsquo;s iniquities which the
poet lashes was his sale of silence. He would countenance
the worst deviation from rectitude for a quart of
wine. Quotation is withheld.</p>

<p>Before the pilgrims started from the Tabarde Inn,
they had well drunk, as appears from Prologue, lines
749-752.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Gret chere made oure hoste us everich on,<br />
And to the souper sette he us anon:<br />
And served us with vitaille of the beste;<br />
Strong was the win, and wel to drinke us leste.<br />
</p>

<p>Nor was this all. After some conversation with mine
host, and certain suggestions made by him as to their
behaviour on the way, we read in Prologue, lines 819-823:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Thus by on assent</span><br />
We ben accorded to his jugement,<br />
And therupon the win was fette anon.<br />
We dronken, and to reste wenten eche on,<br />

</p>

<p>It was just as well they did.</p>

<p>Pass we on to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> themselves.
There is nothing in the Knighte&rsquo;s Tale, as indeed we
should have expected nothing from this &lsquo;veray parfit
gentil knight,&rsquo; apropos of our subject. But directly the
Knighte&rsquo;s Tale was ended, and mine host had requested
the Monk to follow suit, the Miller strikes in, and insists
on telling his tale, a very improper one indeed. This is
the description of the drunken miller and his conduct&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Miller that for-dronken was all pale, <span class="linenum">3123</span></span><br />
So that unethes upon his hors he sat,<br />
He n&rsquo;old avalen neither hood ne hat,                  <span class="linenum">3125</span><br />
Ne abiden no man for his curtesie,<br />
But in Pilates vois he gan to crie,<br />
And swore by armes, and by blood, and bones,<br />
I can a noble tale for the nones,<br />
With which I wol now quite the knightes tale.         <span class="linenum">3130</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our Hoste saw that he was dronken of ale,</span><br />
And sayd; abide, Robin, my leve brother,<br />
Som better man shall tell us first another:<br />
Abide, and let us werken thriftily.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">By Goddes soule (quod he) that wol not I, <span class="linenum">3135</span></span><br />
For I wol speke, or elles go my way.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our Hoste answerd; Tell on a devil way;</span><br />
Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now herkeneth, quod the Miller, all and some:</span><br />
But first I make a protestatioun,                     <span class="linenum">3140</span><br />
That I am dronke, I know it by my soun;<br />
And therefore if that I misspeke or say,<br />
Wite it the ale of Southwerk, I you pray.             <span class="linenum">3143</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is nothing very specially to the point in the
Millere&rsquo;s Tale, but one or two facts show the universal
part that drink played in the period. Thus when
Absalom, the parish clerk, wishes to ingratiate himself
with Alison, the carpenter&rsquo;s wife,</p>

<p class="blockquote">
He sent hire pinnes, methe, and spiced ale,<br />
And wafres piping hot out of the glede:<br />
And for she was of toun, he profered mede.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Lines 3378-3380.</span><br />
</p>

<p>or can the carpenter and his lodger carry on a conversation
without the introduction of &lsquo;a large quart of
mighty ale&rsquo; (line 3497).</p>

<p>The Reve&rsquo;s Tale, which is probably founded upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
similar story in the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, largely turns
upon drink&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, two Cantabs are going to sup and sleep
at the miller&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The miller the toun his doughter send                 <span class="linenum">4134</span><br />
For ale and bred, and roasted hem a goos,             <span class="linenum">4135</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
They soupen, and they speken of solace,               <span class="linenum">4144</span><br />
And drinken ever strong ale at the best.              <span class="linenum">4145</span><br />
Abouten midnight wente they to rest.<br />
</p>

<p>But not, as we are told in a later verse, till &lsquo;that
dronken was all in the crouke,&rsquo; by which time all of the
party had had too much. Their condition is described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Wel hath this miller vernished his hed,<br />
Ful pale he was, for-dronken, and nought red.<br />
He yoxeth, and he speketh thurgh the nose,<br />
As he were on the quakke, or on the pose.             <span class="linenum">4150</span><br />
To bed he goth, and with him goth his wif;<br />
As any jay she light was and jolif,<br />
So was hire joly whistle wel ywette.                  <span class="linenum">4153</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
This miller hath so wisly bibbed ale,                 <span class="linenum">4160</span><br />
That as an hors he snorteth in his slepe.<br />
</p>

<p>In the Man of Lawes Tale we have the account of
a messager being so drunk that, &lsquo;while he slept as a
swine,&rsquo; his letters were stolen from him by the king&rsquo;s
mother, and changed to spite her daughter-in-law. His
orgies are thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
This messager drank sadly ale and wine,               <span class="linenum">5163</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
He dranke, and wel his girdel underfight.             <span class="linenum">5209</span><br />
</p>

<p>Our poet thus apostrophises the sorry fellow:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
O messager, fulfilled of dronkenesse,                 <span class="linenum">5191</span><br />
Strong is thy breth, thy limmes faltren ay,<br />
And thou bewreiest alle secrenesse;<br />
Thy mind is lorne, thou janglest as a jay;<br />
Thy face is tourned in a new array;                   <span class="linenum">5195</span><br />
Ther dronkenesse regneth in any route,<br />
Ther is no conseil hid withouten doute.               <span class="linenum">5197</span><br />
</p>

<p>A virtuous mediæval commentator has written in
the margin of a MS. copy of Chaucer in the Cambridge
Library the following excellent Latin remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><i>O messager.</i> &lsquo;Quid turpius ebrioso, cui f&oelig;tor in ore,
tremor in corpore; qui promit stulta, prodit occulta;
cui mens alienatur, facies transformatur; nullum enim
latet secretum ubi regnat ebrietas.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Query</i>&mdash;Are these words merely the commentator&rsquo;s
effusion and outcome, or are they a quotation from some
Latin writer? If the latter, they would probably have
been the basis of Chaucer&rsquo;s lines here. They say a
good deal in a few words.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Wif of Bathe&rsquo; is one of Chaucer&rsquo;s equivocal
characters. Her remarks are usually incisive. Her
attainments, upon her own confession, were mainly dependent
on the brimming cup; as in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Tho coude I dancen to an harpe smale,<br />
And sing ywis as any nightingale,<br />
When I had dronke a draught of swete wine.<br />
</p>

<p>The same impression is produced in the engravings
of the lady in Knight&rsquo;s <i>Old England</i>. Chaucer continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Metellius, the foule cherle, the swine,<br />
That with a staf beraft his wif hire lif,<br />
For she drank wine, though I had been his wif,<br />
Ne shuld he not have daunted me fro drinke.<br />
</p>

<p>The story about Metellius beating his wife for drinking
is told by Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist.</i> xiv. 13) of one Mecenius,
bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>t Chaucer probably followed Valerius Maximus (vi. 3).</p>

<p>A little further on is a line full of truth&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In woman vinolent is no defence,<br />
</p>

<p>which may have been suggested by the couplet in
<i>Romaunt de la Rose</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Car puisque femme est enyvrée<br />
Et n&rsquo;a point en soy de deffence.<br />
</p>

<p>The Sompnour, or, in other words, the summoner
(so called from delivering the summonses of the archdeacons),
vows vengeance on the Frere (friar) for telling
a tale so palpably levelled at his profession, and, giving
him a Roland for his Oliver, thus describes the Frere of
the period:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Fie on hir pompe, and on hir glotonie,<br />
And on hir lewednesse; I hem defie.                   <span class="linenum">7510</span><br />
Me thinketh they ben like Jovinian,<br />
Fat as a whale, and walken as a swan<br />
Al vinolent as botel in the spence;<br />
Hir praier is of ful gret reverence;<br />
Whan they for soules say the Psalm of Davit,          <span class="linenum">7515</span><br />
Lo, buf they say, <i>cor meum eructavit</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Tyrwhitt informs us that Jovinian was &lsquo;perhaps the
supposed emperour of that name in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
c. lix., whose story was worked up into a <i>Morality</i>,
under the title of &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;orgueil et présomption de l&rsquo;Empereur
Jovinien</i>&mdash;à 19 Personages.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The following lines, still from the Sompnour&rsquo;s Tale,
are not Chaucer&rsquo;s own, but a quotation or paraphrase
from Seneca:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
A lord is lost if he be vicious                       <span class="linenum">7630</span><br />
And dronkennesse is eke a foule record<br />
Of any man, and namely of a lord.                     <span class="linenum">7632</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />

His mind, and eke his limmes everich on.              <span class="linenum">7637</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Marchante&rsquo;s Tale abounds with allusions. Wine
played no unimportant part at the marriage of January
and May. It was not spared at the wedding. As we
read in line 9596:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Bacchus the win hem skinketh al aboute.<br />
</p>

<p>The aged bridegroom primed himself by its aid&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
He drinketh Ipocras, clarré, and vernage<br />
Of spices hot, to encresen his corage.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">Lines 9681, 9682.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in the morning when &lsquo;that the day gan dawe,&rsquo;
we read that &lsquo;then he taketh a sop in fine clarré&rsquo;&mdash;line
9717.</p>

<p>All this, no doubt, is drawn from the marriage
customs of Chaucer&rsquo;s days.</p>

<p>In these times of luxury and excess what an example
does the &lsquo;poure widewe&rsquo; furnish in the Nonnes Prestes
Tale. Truly idyllic!&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Full sooty was hire boure, and eke hire halle,<br />

<p>Could she have divined that one day Professor Mayor
would give to the world &lsquo;Modicus cibi medicussibi&rsquo;?</p>

<p>In the Manciple&rsquo;s Prologue we find the following
lines. The Manciple is chaffing the &lsquo;coke&rsquo; for having
had too much to drink. <i>Inter alia</i>, he remarks, lines
16993, 16994:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I trow that ye have dronken win of ape,<br />
And that is whan men playen with a straw.<br />
</p>

<p>These are worth quoting for the sake of Tyrwhitt&rsquo;s
note on 16993. &lsquo;<i>Wine of ape</i>,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I understood
to mean the same as <i>vin de singe</i> in the old <i>Calendrier
des Bergiers</i>. Sign 1. ii. b. The author is treating of
physiognomy, and in his description of the four temperaments
he mentions, among other circumstances, the
different effects of wine upon them. The choleric, he
says, <i>a vin de Lyon; cest a dire, quant a bien beu veult
tanser, noyser et battre</i>. The sanguine <i>a vin de singe;
quant a plus beu tant est plus joyeux</i>. In the same
manner the phlegmatic is said to have <i>vin de mouton</i>,
and the melancholick <i>vin de porceau</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the Manciple&rsquo;s Prologue, lines 17043 to 17050, we
have the following praise of wine as a reconciler:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Then gan our hoste to laughen wonder loude,<br />

<p>If <i>Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus</i> be a true
rule, we might say that Chaucer liked his glass.</p>

<p>In the Persones Tale, under heading <i>De Gulâ</i>, we
read, &lsquo;After avarice cometh glotonie, which is expresse
agenst the commandement of God. Glotonie is unmesurable
appetit to ete or to drinke.... This sinne
hath many spices. The first is dronkennesse, that is
the horrible sepulture of manne&rsquo;s reson: and this is
dedly sinne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Rime of Sire Thopas is tantalising. It breaks
off just as we are assured that Sire Thopas</p>

<p><i>Hiatus valde deflendus!</i> Yet we find with strange

<p class="blockquote">

How that the geaunt should be ded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betide what so betide.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Lines 13693, 13694 show the early use of the
nutmeg with liquor&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And notemuge to put in ale,<br />

</p>

<p>as in the old song&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">

Nutmegs and cloves.<br />
</p>

<p>This ample history of manners from one of our
greatest poets scarcely needs to be supplemented.
Indeed, little can be added even from that withering
satire of Robert Longlande, entitled the <i>Vision of Pierce
Plowman</i>, who, lashing everybody, did not spare the
corruptions of the Church. To this <i>vision</i> has been
commonly annexed a poem, called &lsquo;Pierce the Plowman&rsquo;s
Crede,&rsquo; a satire on the Mendicant Friars. These last
had sprung up in the preceding century. They were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
indeed, a necessity of the time, so far had the monastic
orders degenerated from their primitive simplicity, so
wholly were they abandoned to luxury and indolence.
In the following lines of the &lsquo;Crede&rsquo; a Franciscan is
defending his order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Of al men upon mold we Minorites most sheweth<br />
The pure Aposteles lif, with penance on erthe,<br />
And suen [follow] hem in sanctite, and sufferen wel harde.<br />
We haunten not tavernes, ne hobelen abonten<br />
At marketes and miracles we medeley us never.<br />
</p>

<p>The Early English Text Society has done good
service in publishing one of the many mediæval handbooks
of the same kind, called <i>Instructions for Parish
Priests</i>. The book is by John Myrk, a canon regular
of St. Austin. Amongst these instructions the priest is
bidden to eschew drunkenness, gluttony, pride, sloth,
and envy. He must keep from taverns, trading,
wrestling, shooting, hunting, hawking, and dancing.
Dr. Cutts infers from Chaucer&rsquo;s description of the poor
parson of a town, that these instructions were not thrown
away upon the mediæval parish priests.</p>

<p>The legislation of the fourteenth century, so far as
it concerns our subject, was of an in-and-out character.
It enacted and repealed, repealed and enacted. In 1330
it was ordained: &lsquo;Because there are more taverners in
the realm than were wont to be, selling as well corrupt
wines as wholesome, and have sold the gallon at such
price as they themselves would, because there was no
punishment ordained for them, as hath been for them
that sell bread and ale, to the great hurt of the people,&rsquo;
that wine must be sold at reasonable prices, and that
the wines should be tested twice a year&mdash;at Easter
and Michaelmas, oftener if needful&mdash;and corrupt win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>es
poured out, and the vessels broken.</p>

<p>In 1338 wine was taxed, on a great emergency.
Edward III. wanted a vast sum to pay the subsidies
which he had granted to his foreign allies. The great
men granted him a moiety of their wool, which sold for
400,000<i>l.</i>; besides a duty of 2<i>s.</i> a tun upon wine, added
to the usual customs paid by all foreign merchants.</p>

<p>The preamble of the Act of 1365 deserves special
attention:&mdash;&lsquo;The King wills of his grace and sufferance
that all merchant denizens that be not artificers, shall
pass into Gascoign to fetch wines thence, to the end and
intent that by this general licence greater liberty may
come, and greater market may be of wines within the
realm; and that the Gascoigns and other aliens may
come into the realm with their wines, and freely sell
them without any disturbance or impeachment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By the 42nd Edward III., c. 8, rigour was again
imposed, and wines forbidden to be brought into England
save by Gascons and other aliens. In the next
year the previous Act was renewed at the request of his
son the Prince, who found the subsidies and customs of
wines diminished in his principality of Aquitaine, by
reason of the falling off of the wine trade with England.
A revival of the trade ensued. Froissart states that in
1372 a fleet arrived at Bordeaux from England of not less
than two hundred sail of merchantmen in quest of wines.</p>

<p>In 1378 foreigners were allowed to sell wine in gross
but not in retail.</p>

<p>The same contradictions manifest themselves in the
Acts of Richard II.&rsquo;s reign as in those of his predecessor;
<i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1381 no sweet wines or claret could be sold ret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ail.
In the following year the price of foreign wines was
again regulated. It was enacted that the best wines of
Gascony, Osey, and Spain, and Rhenish wines should
be sold for 100 shillings, and the best Rochelle wines at
6 marks the tun; and by retail, the former at 6<i>d.</i>, the
latter at 4<i>d.</i>, a gallon. Marvellous to relate, Holinshed
states that, before the close of the reign, so abundant
was the article that it was sold at the maximum price of
20<i>s.</i> a tun.</p>

<p>In 1387, it was enacted that no wine be carried <i>out</i>
of the realm.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how our sumptuary laws
recognised certain seasons, and exempted them from
their operation. Christmas, for example, had not only
been set apart for sacred observance, but had become
a time of feasting and revelry. When Edward III., in
his tenth year, tried to restrain his subjects from over
luxury, exception was made in the case of the great
feasts of the year&mdash;&lsquo;La veile et le jour de Noel, le jour
de Saint Estiephne, le jour de l&rsquo;an renoef [New Year&rsquo;s
Day], les jours de la Tiphaynei et de la Purification de
Notre Dame.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We have already found that attention was drawn to
taverns in the time of Edward I. In the reign of
Edward III. only three taverns were allowed in the
metropolis. Publicans were already compelled by law
to put up a sign. Thus, in 1393, Florence North, a
Chelsea brewer, was &lsquo;presented&rsquo; for not putting up
the usual sign. The penalty was the forfeiture of their
ale. With other trades it was optional. Conversely, the
taking away of a publican&rsquo;s licence was accompanied by
the removal of his sign&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
For this gross fault I here do damn thy licence,<br />
Forbidding thee ever to tap or draw;<br />
For instantly I will in mine own person<br />
Command the constables to pull down thy sign.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><br />
</p>

<p>By the gradual institution of <i>inns</i>, where travellers
could obtain food and lodging, the old methods of hospitality
began to pass away. &lsquo;The convenient chamber
for guests,&rsquo; which we find in the inventories of a
country parson&rsquo;s house in the middle ages, was becoming
a relic of the past. This, and the more public <i>hospitium</i>,
or guest-house, within the walls of the monasteries, had
for ages furnished the shelter and provender which could
only thus be gotten.</p>

<p>In the time of Richard II. the Little Park at Windsor
was used as a vineyard for home consumption. Thus
Stowe (<i>Chronicle</i>, p. 143) says that among the archives
of the Court of Pleas of the Forest and Honours at
Windsor, is to be seen the &lsquo;yearly account of the charges
of the planting of the vines that in the time of Richard
II. grew in great plenty within the Little Park, as also the
making of the wine itself, whereof some part was spent in
the king&rsquo;s house, and some part sold to his profit, the
tithes whereof were paid to the Abbot of Waltham.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the inutility of home vineyards is demonstrated
from the cheapness of foreign wines at this time. In
1342 the price of Gascon wines in London was 4<i>d.</i>, and
that of Rhenish, 6<i>d.</i> per gallon; and in 1389, foreign
wine was only 20<i>s.</i> per tun for the best, and 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
the second&mdash;that is, about three halfpence a dozen.</p>

<p>But to turn to the king himself. The pageant, or
royal entertainment, on the accession of Richard II. is
described by the chronicler Walsingham. The city was
most richly adorned, and the conduits ran with wine for
three hours. In the upper end of the Cheap was e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>rected
a castle with four towers, on two sides of which ran forth
wine abundantly. In the towers were placed four
beautiful girls dressed in white, who, on the king&rsquo;s
approach, blew in his face leaves of gold, and filling cups
of gold with wine at the spouts of the castle, presented
them to the king and his nobles.</p>

<p>The citizens had signified their joy in much the same
way before, when Edward I. returned from the Holy
Land. Maitland, in his <i>London</i>, seems to have regarded
with wonder the fact that the very conduits in
the streets through which the cavalcade passed ran
with wine; but it happened before, and happened very
often afterwards. Mr. Morewood (<i>Hist. Ineb. Liq.</i>) fell
into the same error, and exclaims, &lsquo;To this extravagance
there are few parallels, except that of Polemkin, when
he gave a magnificent feast to the Empress Catherine,
at his palace in the Taurida, when the conservatory
fountains were filled with champagne and claret, and
served to the company by means of silver pumps applied
to those reservoirs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king was young when he came to the throne,
extravagant, and fond of luxury. His Christmases seem
to have been kept with especial splendour, and this
to the very close of his unfortunate reign. In 1399
there was a royal Christmas at Westminster, when the
consumption was prodigious. In the previous Christmas,
at Lichfield, where the pope&rsquo;s nuncio and other
foreigners were present, they got rid of two hundred tuns
of wine and two thousand oxen. But the king had a

Tresylian, his Chief Justice of the King&rsquo;s Bench; and no
better epitome of the king&rsquo;s ill star can be give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>n than a
stanza from the tragedy of <i>The Fall of Robert Tresylian</i>
(1388):</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Thus the king, outleaping the limits of his law,<br />
Not reigning but raging, as youth did him entice,<br />
Wise and worthy persons from court did daily draw,<br />
Sage counsel set at nought, proud vaunters were in price,<br />
And roisters bear the rule, which wasted all in vice:<br />
Of riot and excess grew scarcity and lack,<br />
Of lacking came taxing, and so went wealth to rack.<br />
</p>

<p>Henry IV. came to the throne in 1399. A pageant
of the kind already mentioned was held. Froissart
notices that there were seven fountains in Cheapside, and
other streets he passed through, which perpetually ran
with white and red wines. Profusion reigned supreme
in high quarters; among the articles which furnished
the breakfast table of the nobility were&mdash;for a gentleman
and his lady, in Lent, a quart of beer and the same
quantity of wine. And a gallon of beer and a quart of
wine at their <i>liveries</i>, a repast taken in their bedrooms
immediately before going to roost.</p>

<p>In looking through bills of entertainments at this
period, one cannot help observing the contrast between
the relative costs of the meats and drinks then and now.
Then, the wine, ale, &amp;c., were about one third of the
entire cost, now the drink is oftener much the heavier
item. This would be misleading, did we not take into
consideration how much strong drink is made to yield to
the revenue. The relative price of meats and drinks at
that time wholly differ from the present relation. But
wine was gradually becoming a dearer commodity.
Malmsey in the reign of Henry IV. used to fetch the
average price of 280 gallons for 5<i>l.</i> That sum would
scarcely have bought half the amount in the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Richard III.</p>

<p>The dissipated life led by the youth of the time
appears in the reminiscences of the poet Occleve of his
own conduct. If youth needs a warning against folly,
he can do little better than study <i>La male regie de
T. Hoccleve</i>, or <i>Occleve&rsquo;s Misrule</i>. The tavern sign
was to him an irresistible temptation. Westminster Gate
was then noted for its taverns and cook-shops, at which
the lavishness of Occleve made him a welcome guest.
To this he alludes&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Wher was a greater maister eek than Y,<br />
Or bet acqweynted at Westmynster Gate,<br />

</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the arguments adduced by a modern
historian to the contrary, the weight of evidence is overwhelming
that the early life of Henry V. was a course of
dissipation. His active spirit (in the language of Hume)
broke out in extravagances of every kind; and the riot
of pleasure, the frolic of debauchery, the outrage of the
wine, filled the vacancies of a mind better adapted to
the pursuits of ambition and the cares of government.
Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Henry IV. the reflection
upon his son&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Whilst I ...<br />
See riot and dishonor stain the brow<br />
Of my young Harry.<br />
</p>

<p>The abandoned Falstaff looked at the matter from
another point of view, of course. He is represented as
saying, &lsquo;Hereof comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant;
for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father,
he hath, like lean, steril, and bare land, manured, husbanded,
and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking
good, and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become
very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the
first human principle I would teach them should be, to
forswear their potations, and addict themselves to sack.&rsquo;
Yet even Falstaff could tell the truth sometimes, for in
the early part of the same sentence, amidst a hurricane of
rubbish, he tells that wine makes the blood &lsquo;course from
the inwards to the parts extreme.&rsquo; One fancies one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
reading Dr. B. W. Richardson as he tells, &lsquo;wine propels
the blood violently <i>from the heart</i> to the extremities.&rsquo; But
Henry V. found place for repentance. His life as king
was widely different from his life as prince. Among his
troops at Agincourt drunkenness was counted a disgrace.
So impressed was he with the bane of it, that he would
gladly have cut down all the vines in France.</p>

<p>In the <i>Liber Albus</i>, compiled in this reign by John
Carpenter, common clerk, and Richard Whittington,
mayor, appears in full the oath of the <i>ale-conners</i>.
These were officers appointed to look after the quality
of ale, beer, and bread, to whom allusion is made in
the <i>Cobler of Canterburie</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
A nose he had that gan show<br />
What liquor he loved I trow;<br />
For he had before long seven yeare,<br />
Beene of the towne the <i>ale-conner</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The following is the oath&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You shall swear, that you shall know of no brewer or brewster,
cook, or pie-baker, in your ward, who sells the gallon of best ale
for more than one penny halfpenny, or the gallon of second for
more than one penny, or otherwise than by measure sealed and full
of clear ale; or who brews less than he used to do before this cry,
by reason hereof, or withdraws himself from following his trade the
rather by reason of this cry; or if any persons shall do contrary to
any one of these points, you shall certify the Alderman of your
ward [thereof] and of their names. And that you, so soon as you
shall be required to taste any ale of a brewer or brewster, shall be
ready to do the same; and in case that it be less good than it used
to be before this cry, you, by assent of your Alderman, shall set a
reasonable price thereon, according to your discretion; and if any
one shall afterwards sell the same above the said price, unto your
said Alderman you shall certify the same. And that for gift,
promise, knowledge, hate, or other cause whatsoever, no brewer,
brewster, huckster, cook, or pie-baker, who acts against any one o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>f
the points aforesaid, you shall conceal, spare, or tortuously aggrieve;
nor when you are required to taste ale, shall absent yourself without
reasonable cause and true; but all things which unto your office
pertain to do, you shall well and lawfully do.&mdash;So God you help,
and the saints.</p></div>

<p>So it is to be feared that there were some black sheep
in the trade then, as now. Others certainly not so, for
in this same fifteenth century we find that a licence was
granted to John Calcot, landlord of the &lsquo;Chequers,&rsquo; a
tavern in Calcot&rsquo;s Alley, Lambeth, to have an oratory in
the house, and a chaplain for the use of his family and
guests, so long as the house should continue orderly
and respectable, and <i>adapted to the celebration of Divine
service</i>.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the ale-conners extended to
offences of omission as well as commission. Thus we
find them presenting one Thomas Cokesale, for refusing
to sell ale to his neighbours while he had some on sale,
and even while the sign (the ale-stake) was out. He
was fined 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, in 1461, one Lentroppe was presented
for having, contrary to the order, brewed three
times under one display of the sign or ale-stake. For
this he had to pay 6<i>d.</i> The man offended by brewing
three times, and only making one signal of brewing.
This, if he had not been detected, would have enabled
him to sell two brewings without the liquor having been
tasted by the proper officers, and the public might have
had ale sold to them &lsquo;not sufficiently mighty of the
corn, or wholesome for man&rsquo;s body.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Another local
law, mentioned in Scrope&rsquo;s <i>History of Castle Combe</i>, was
that no one was to brew in 1461 at the same time as
the Churchwardens were brewing the church-ale for th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>e
profit of the church, under pain of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; nor to
brew or sell till all the ale brewed for the church was
entirely sold. This was brewed for the benefit of the
common fund for the <i>relief</i> of the poor in 1590. We
pause here to consider the institution known as a</p>

<p><i>Church-ale</i>,</p>

<p>of which <i>Easter-ales</i> and <i>Whitsun-ales</i> are simply species.
And first, their origin. The idea is without any doubt
taken from the <i>Agapæ</i>, or Love Feasts, so famous in the
early Church. Many of the features of these feasts were
revived in the <i>wakes</i> of the middle ages, of which such
was the popularity that the officers of parishes conceived
that some things novel in name and character, but preserving
the elements which made the wakes so popular,
would answer the purpose and promote the objects they
had in view.</p>

<p>There is an old pre-Reformation indenture in Dodsworth&rsquo;s
MSS., which not only shows the design of the
church-ale, but explains the particular use and application
of the word <i>ale</i>. The parishioners of Elveston and
Okebrook in Derbyshire agree jointly &lsquo;to brew four ales,
and every ale of one quarter of malt, betwixt this and
the feast of St. John Baptist next coming. And that
every inhabitant of the said town of Okebrook shall be
at the several ales. And every husband and his wife
shall pay two pence, every cottager one penny, and all
the inhabitants of Elveston shall have and receive all
the profits and advantages coming of the said ales, to
the use and behoof of the said church of Elveston, and
the inhabitants of Elveston shall brew eight ales betw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>een
this and the feast of St. John Baptist, at the which ales
the inhabitants of Okebrook shall come and pay as
before rehersed, and if he be away at one ale to pay
at the other ale for both.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Before the Reformation there were no poor rates. In
their place were the charitable dole given at the religious
houses, voluntary assessments towards church repairs,
and the church-ale. The latter fell in best with the
humour of the people; for a time it was tolerated because
probably innocent, and in it a ready method was
discovered for maintaining the fabric of the church, and
furnishing its necessary ornaments. Stubbs, in his
<i>Anatomie of Abuses</i> (1585), thus describes them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In certaine townes where dronken Bacchus beares swaie,
against Christmas and Easter, Whitsondaie or some other tyme, the
churchwardens of every parishe, with the consent of the whole
parishe, provide halfe a score, or twentie quarters of mault, whereof
some they buy of the churche stocke, and some is given them of the
parishioners themselves, every one conferring somewhat, according
to his abilitie; whiche maulte being made into very strong ale or
bere, is sette to sale, either in the churche or some other place
assigned to that purpose. Then when this is set abroche, well is he
that can gete the soonest to it, and spend the most at it. In this
kinde of practice they continue sixe weekes, a quarter of a yeare,
yea, halfe a yeare together. That money, they say, is to repaire
their churches and chappels with, to buy bookes for service, cuppes
for the celebration of the sacrament, surplesses for Sir John, and
such other necessaries, and they maintaine other extraordinarie
charges in their parish besides.</p></div>

<p>That these ales were eminently productive, the
churchwardens&rsquo; accounts of many parishes attest. Thus
in Kingston-upon-Thames, the proceeds of the church-ale
in 1526 are entered as 7<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>, not much short of
100<i>l.</i> as money goes now.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>We find them satirised in <i>Pierce Plowman</i> thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I am occupied everie daye, holye daye, and other,<br />
With idle tales at the ale, and other while in churches.<br />
</p>

<p><i>In churches.</i> Though they were not usually, if ever,
held there, but in a place called the <i>church-house</i>. Thus
Carew (<i>Survey of Cornwall</i>) says: &lsquo;Whitsontide, upon
which holidays the neighbours meet at the church-house,
and there merily feed on their owne victuals, contributing
some petty portion to the stock, which, by many smells,
growth to a meetly greatness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In process of time of course they degenerated. The
pulpits of the sixteenth century freely denounced them.
A typical sermon on the abuses of the day is that of
William Kethe, preached at Blandford in 1570, at which
time ales must have been kept in his neighbourhood on
Sunday, &lsquo;which holy day the multitude call their revelyng
day, which day is spent in bul-beatings, beare-beatings,
bowlings, dicyng, cardyng, daunsynges, drunkenness, and
whoredome.&rsquo; And when we remember that it is recorded
of an old song, that</p>

<p class="blockquote">
It hath been sung at festivals,<br />
On ember eves and <i>holy ales</i>,<br />
</p>

<p>we shall the better appreciate the nature of the fall.
&lsquo;Desinit in piscem mulier formosa supernè.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Efforts were made in this reign of Henry VI. for the
better observance of Sunday; and, here and there, there
are indications that efforts were made locally to bring
about &lsquo;Sunday closing.&rsquo; Mr. Bridgett has adduced a
few examples. In 1428 the corporation of Hull made
an order for the observance of the Sunday. No market
was to be kept, under penalty of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for sellers, and
3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for buyers; no butchers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> to expose meat for
sale, nor cooks to dress or sell except to strangers, and to
them only before seven o&rsquo;clock; no tradesmen to keep
shops open; no vintners nor ale-house keepers to deliver
or sell ale, under the same penalties. London made an
attempt to suppress Sunday trading, but it was ineffectual.
In the year 1444 &lsquo;an Act was made, by authority
of the Common Council of London, that upon the Sunday
should no manner of thing, within the franchise of
the city, be bought or sold, neither victual nor other
things; nor none artificer should bring his ware to any
man to be worn or occupied that day, as tailor&rsquo;s garments
or cordwainer&rsquo;s shoes; and so likewise of all other
occupations; the which ordinance held but a while.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was very little legislation upon these matters
in Henry VI.&rsquo;s reign. The planting of <i>hops</i> was prohibited.
They were used by the brewers in the Netherlands
early in the fourteenth century; and the use of
them in beer was brought into England from Artois.
But there will be more occasion to speak of them later
on, when we shall find that privileges were granted to <i>hop-grounds</i>.
In this reign the Brewery Company was incorporated,
and we can readily believe that its brew was
duly appreciated by John Lydgate, the monk of Bury.</p>

<p>Beer had risen immensely in price from the thirteenth
to the fifteenth century. When the Archbishop
of Canterbury visited his land at Tarring, in Sussex, in
1277, four gallons of the best beer were to be charged
only 1<i>d.</i>; whereas a tariff of 1464 shows an extraordinary
advance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>A century later it had again risen fifty per cent.</p>

<p>In an ordinance for the household of George, Duke
of Clarence (Dec. 9, 1469), the sum of 20<i>l.</i> is allowed for
the purveying of &lsquo;Malvesie, Romenay, Osey, Bastard,
Muscadelle, and other sweete wynes.&rsquo; This Romenay or
Rumney has nothing to do with Rome or the Romagna, but
was probably made from Greek vines, as Henderson suggests,
derived from Rum-ili, a name given by the Saracens
to Greece. The <i>Osey</i> above mentioned, or Auxois,
was in old time a name for Alsace. It was richly and
highly flavoured.</p>

<p>The mention of the Duke of Clarence brings up the
spectre of his untimely end. A shroud of mystery veils
its entire circumstances. He was charged with high
treason and condemned to death. Ten days afterwards
it was announced that he had died in the Tower. Was
he first murdered and then drowned, as Shakespeare
thought,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> or is the old story to be believed, that he was
drowned in a butt of malmsey? Since the death of his
dearly loved wife, Isabel of Warwick, he had abandoned
himself to intemperance, to drown his grief. With <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>such
a habit contracted, with vexed conscience, in the despair
of condemnation, and with a butt of his favourite drink
by his side, what more natural than to suppose him to
have been a miserable suicide? However, the weight of
testimony leans to the other theory&mdash;that he was stabbed
by Richard&rsquo;s order, and the body thrown into the malmsey
to make believe that he had unwittingly drowned
himself under the influence of drink.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin Leake gives the origin of the term <i>Malmsey</i>:
Monemvasia, now an island connected with the
coast of Laconia by a bridge. This name, derived from
its position (μόνε ἐμβασία, <i>single entrance</i>), was corrupted
by the Italians to Malvasia; this place, celebrated for its
fine wines, had its name changed to Malvoisie in French,
and Malmsey in English, and came to be applied to many
of the rich wines of Greece, the Archipelago, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The consumption of strong drink at public entertainments
was something prodigious in the fifteenth century.
At the banquet upon the occasion of the installation of
George Neville, Archbishop of York, in 1464, no less
than 300 tuns of ale and 100 tuns of wine were consumed.
In the household of Archbishop Booth, his predecessor,
it is stated that about 80 tuns of claret were
consumed annually.</p>

<p>The usages of <i>assay</i> were at this time remarkable.
Every cup of drink served to the great man of the house
was assayed twice, once in the buttery and again in the
hall. In the buttery the butler was required to drink,
under the marshal&rsquo;s eye, some of every vessel of liquor
sent to the high table; and at the same time the marshal
covered with its lid every cup, before committing it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>lord&rsquo;s cupbearer. It was treason for a cupbearer to
raise the lid of a vessel thus confided to him, on his way
from the buttery to the table; but he sipped it before his
lord took a draught. On serving his master the cupbearer
knelt, removed the lid, and poured some of the
drink into the inverted cover. When he had drunk this,
the servant handed the cup to his master, who, when he
saw the liquor assayed before his eyes, accepted it as a
liquor of <i>credence</i> which he might drink trustfully.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>But here we must stay for a while and inquire what
action the Church had been taking for the past century
to check intemperance. In the year 1359, Archbishop
Islep, in his Constitution, informs Michael de Northburg,
Bishop of London, that though it is provided by sanctions
of law and canon that all Lord&rsquo;s days be venerably observed
from eve to eve, so that neither markets, negotiations,
nor courts be kept, nor any country work done, that
so every faithful man may go to his parish church to
worship and pray, yet &lsquo;we are, to our great heart&rsquo;s grief,
informed that a detestable, nay damnable, perverseness
has prevailed, insomuch that in many places, markets,
unlawful meetings of men who neglect their churches,
various tumults and other occasions of evil are committed,
revels and drunkenness, and many other dishonest doings
are practised, ... wherefore we strictly command you
that ye without delay canonically admonish, and effectually
persuade in virtue of obedience, those of your subjects
whom ye find culpable, that they do wholly abstain
from markets, courts, and the other unlawful practices
for the future,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In a constitution held three years later, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Archbishop Islep lays intemperance to the charge of
some of the priests, and imposes strenuous penalties in
default of amendment.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In 1363 Archbishop Thoresby
complains that it had become common for persons to
meet in churches on the vigils of saints, and offend
against God by their practices; that in the exequies of
the dead, some turned the house of mourning and prayer
into the house of laughter and excess to the great peril
of their own souls. These were strictly forbidden to
continue such practices.</p>

<p>In the year 1468 the Prior of Canterbury and the
commissaries made a visitation (the see being then
vacant); and it was ordered that potations made in the
churches, commonly called <i>give-ales</i> or <i>bride-ales</i>, should
be discontinued, under penalty of excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="center"><i>Bride-ale</i></p>

<p>was so called from the bride&rsquo;s selling ale on the wedding
day, and friends contributing what they liked in payment
of it. Brand imagines that the expense was defrayed by
the friends of the married pair when circumstances were
such as to need help. It was also called <i>bride-stake</i>,
<i>bride-wain</i>, and <i>bride-bush</i>; the bush sufficiently signifying
the nature of the gathering, inasmuch as it was
the ancient badge of a country ale-house. Before the
festivities proper began on the return from the bridal
ceremony, it appears that a curious drinking custom
prevailed in the church. Wine, with sops immersed,
was there drunk, and bowls were kept in the church for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>this purpose. Thus, in an inventory of goods belonging
to Wilsdon church in the sixteenth century, occurs the
item, &lsquo;two masers (mazers) that were appointed to remayne
in the church for to drink in at bride-ales.&rsquo;
Shakespeare alludes to this custom in his <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>, where Petruchio</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Calls for wine:&mdash;&lsquo;A health,&rsquo; quoth he ...<br />
... Quaff&rsquo;d off the muscadel,<br />
And threw the <i>sops</i> all in the sexton&rsquo;s face.<br />
</p>

<p>The practice continued in force for a long time, for
we find allusion to the same custom in the year 1720 in
the <i>Compleat Vintner</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
What priest can join two lovers&rsquo; hands,<br />

Essential to the sacred knot,<br />
And that each bridegroom and his bride<br />
Believ&rsquo;d they were not firmly ty&rsquo;d<br />
Till Bacchus with his bleeding tvn,<br />
Had finished what the priest begun.<br />
</p>

<p>The wine thus drunk is called by Ben Jonson a
&lsquo;knitting cup.&rsquo; After the ceremony they retired to a
tavern or went home, and then the orgies begun. In the
words of an old writer, &lsquo;When they come home from the
church, then beginneth excess of eatyng and drynking,
and as much is waisted in one daye as were sufficient
for the two newe-maried folkes halfe a year to lyve on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But these customs are not peculiar to England only.
The Scotch have their &lsquo;penny bride-ale&rsquo; to help those
who cannot pay the expense of the wedding feast. In
Germany, when a window was put in or altered, was the
<i>fenster-bier</i> (window-beer). At the churchings of women
was the <i>kark-bier</i> (church-beer). At funerals w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>as the
<i>grab-bier</i> (grave-beer), beer forming an essential part of
all such observances.</p>

<p>Edward IV. died in 1488, the victim of mortified
ambition. His habits of life were licentious and intemperate.
He died under a violent fever aggravated by
excess. We can only hope that he died, as it is reported,
a penitent. An account is given in the Paston Letters
(cccxliv.) of an intended <i>progress</i> of the king, probably to
facilitate his benevolences. In this, Sir John Paston is
urged to warn William Gogney and his fellows &lsquo;to purvey
them of wine enough, for every man beareth me in hand
that the town shall be drank dry, as York was when the
king was there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In this reign the Earls of Warenne and Surrey
possessed the privilege of licensing ale-houses. Mention
has already been made of the &lsquo;Crown,&rsquo; in Cheapside.
In 1467 this house was kept by one Walter Walters, who
in harmless pleasantry gave it out that he would make
his son &lsquo;heir to the &ldquo;Crown.&rdquo;&rsquo; This so displeased his
Majesty Edward IV. that he ordered the man to be put
to death for high treason.</p>

<p>One piece of legislation remains to be told before
closing the period. In the first year of Richard III.
(c. 13), it was enacted that malmsey should in future be
imported only in butts of 126 gallons. This measure
was for the prevention of frauds on the revenue. It was
repealed by an Act of George IV.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="subheading">TUDOR PERIOD.</p>


<p>The legislative enactments of the reign of Henry VII.
demand minute attention. With a certain modification,
it is true that the direct legislative sanction of the
liquor traffic dates from this reign. The revival of the
trade of England was a great object with this monarch.
The greater part of the foreign trade of England had
hitherto been carried on by foreigners in foreign vessels
of burden. Henry was sensible that this prevented the
increase of English ships and sailors; so, to remedy this
in part, he got a law passed in his first Parliament, that
no Gascony or Guienne wines should be imported into
any part of his dominions, except in English, Irish, or
Welsh ships, navigated by English, Irish, or Welsh
sailors, which obliged them to build ships and go to sea,
or to lack their favourite liquor. This law was enforced
and enlarged by an Act made in his third Parliament
(1487), when it was enacted that no wines of Gascony
or Guienne, or woads of Tholouse, should be imported
into England, except in ships belonging to the king or
some of his subjects; and that all such wines and woads
imported in foreign bottoms should be forfeited.</p>

<p>By 7 Henry VII., c. 7, it was enacted (in order to
counteract the duty of four ducats a tun lately imposed
by the Venetians) that &lsquo;every merchant stranger (except
Englishmen born) bringing malmseys into this realm,
should pay 18<i>s.</i> custom for each butt, over and above
the custom aforetime used to be paid.&rsquo; The price of the
butt was fixed at 4<i>l.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Of far more importance was the Act of 1496, passed
&lsquo;against vacabonds and beggars.&rsquo; This empowers two
justices of the peace &lsquo;to rejecte and put away comen
ale-selling in townes and places where they shall think
convenyent, and to take suertie of the keepers of ale-houses
of their gode behavyng, by the discrecion of the
seid justices, and in the same to be avysed and aggreed
at the time of their sessions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Leland gives in his <i>Collectanea</i> a wine list which
indicates the comparative prices of wines at this time:&mdash;</p>

<p>We get a good notion of the daily routine of court
living in this reign from the ordinances of the royal
household. There is nothing whatever in them indicative
of excess, but they are interesting as matters of
history, and records of etiquette. &lsquo;When the king
cometh from evensong into his great chamber on the
even of the day of estate, the chamberlain must warn
the usher before evensong that the king will take spice
and wine in his great chamber.... Then shall the
gentleman usher bring thither the esquire, and especially
the king&rsquo;s server (officer who set, removed, tasted, &amp;c.)
to bring the king&rsquo;s spice plate.... And when the
usher cometh to the cellar door, charge a squire for the
body with the king&rsquo;s own cup.&rsquo; This is simply a specimen
of pages of like directions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>Entries in the Household Book of Edward Stafford,
Duke of Buckingham, furnish details of a nobleman&rsquo;s
style of living at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
On the Feast of the Nativity 290 persons dined and
supped at Thornbury Castle, on which occasion were
consumed eleven pottles and three quarts of Gascony
wine, and 171 flagons of ale. This was not excessive for
the times, the vices of which are admirably pictured in
William Dunbar&rsquo;s remarkable poem, <i>The Dance</i>. He
describes a procession of the seven deadly sins in the
lower regions. Gluttony brings up the rear:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Then the foul monster Gluttony,<br />
Of wame [belly] insatiable and gredy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dance he did him dress:</span><br />
Him followed mony foul dronkart,<br />
With can and collop, cup and quart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In surfett and excess.</span><br />
Fully many a wasteful wally-drag [outcast],<br />
With wames [bellies] unwieldable did forth wag,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In creische [fat] that did incress:</span><br />
Drink, aye, they cried, with mony a gape,<br />
The fiends gave them hait leid to lap [hot lead to lap]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their levery [reward] was no less.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Household Book of the Earl of Northumberland
is another capital illustration of the table life of the
higher nobles. In reading the estimates, it must be
taken into account that the household consisted of 166
persons. The allowance of grain per month gave 250
quarters of malt at 4<i>s.</i>, two hogsheads to the quarter.
This allowance may be thought to speak more for the
temperance of the retainers than for the liberality of the
lord. The wine was dispensed more liberally. An
annual consumption showed ten tuns and two hogsheads
of Gascony. A breakfast bill of fare appears thus:
&lsquo;Breakfastis for my lorde and my ladye. Furst a loof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of brede in trenchers, two manchets, one quart of bere,
a quart of wine, half a chyne of muton, ells a chyne of
beif boyled.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A searching visiting of monasteries, indeed of all
ecclesiastics within the dominion, was entrusted by
Henry VII. to his vicar-general and vice-gerent, Thomas
Cromwell. The scrutiny was intended mainly for the
monasteries. The eighty-six articles of instruction
compass a large field of minute inquiry. The commissioners
were doubtless much indebted to monastic
factions and animosities for some of the information
which they gained. The scrutiny revealed terrible
irregularities in some cases, prominent among which
were the vices of gluttony and drunkenness. The result
of this official investigation was the dissolution of the
smaller monasteries. And thus good was effected; for,
however much we discount the charges alleged, for the
reasons above suggested, the lives of the inmates had
become a far and wide scandal. Innocent VIII. sent a
bull to Archbishop Morton in 1490, in which he informs
him that he had heard with great grief from persons
worthy of credit, that the monks of all the different
orders in England had grievously degenerated, that
giving themselves up to a reprobate sense they led
dissolute lives. But the archbishop was fully aware of
the evil, for in 1487 he had convened a synod of the
prelates and clergy of his province, for the reformation
of the manners of the clergy. In this convocation many
of the London clergy were accused of spending their
whole time in taverns. But there is no disguising the
fact that profuseness of living was countenanced in the
highest places of the Church; which, if it does not
excuse, at any rate explains the excesses of the &lsquo;i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>nferior
clergy.&rsquo; As late as 1504, when William Warham was
enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury, a feast was
given for which was procured&mdash;fifty-four quarters of
wheat, six pipes of red wine, four of claret, one of choice
white, one of white for the kitchen, one butt of Malmsey,
one pipe of wine of Osey, two tierces of Rhenish wine,
four tuns of London ale, six of Kentish ale, and twenty
of English beer.</p>

<p>It is curious how many of our tavern signs originated
from incidents in the history of our sovereigns. The
&lsquo;Red Dragon&rsquo; was in compliment to Henry VII., who
adopted this device for his standard at Bosworth Field.
It was in old times the ensign of the famous Cadwaller,
the last of the British kings, from whom the Tudors
descended. The field of Bosworth furnished matter for
another sign. The hawthorn-bush crowned was adopted
by Henry VII. in allusion to the crown of his predecessor
which was found hidden in a hawthorn-bush after the
battle. But the seventh Henry escaped the honour (?)
conferred upon his successor and perpetuated, of being
immortalised by his portrait as Bluff Harry on scores
of tavern signboards. It is stated in the <i>History of
Signboards</i> that at Hever, in Kent, one of these rude
portraits of Henry VIII. may be seen. Near this village
the Bolleyn, or Bullen, family held possessions, and old
people in the district still show where Henry used to
meet Anne Bolleyn. Anyhow, years after the sad death
of Anne, the village ale-house had for its sign, &lsquo;Bullen
Butchered.&rsquo; When the place changed hands, the name
of the house was altered to the &lsquo;Bull and Butcher,&rsquo;
which sign existed till recently, but was altered at the
request of the clergyman of the parish, who suggested
the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; and the village painter was com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>missioned
to make the alteration. The bluff features of
the monarch were drawn; and in his hands was placed
an axe, and so the sign remains at present.</p>

<p>In the collection of ordinances for the Royal Household
we have an account of the ceremony of <i>wasselling</i>,
as was practised at Court on Twelfth Night in the reign
of Henry VII. The ancient custom of pledging each
other out of the same cup had given place to the use of
different cups. Moreover, &lsquo;when the steward came in
at the doore with the wassel, he was to crye three tymes,
&ldquo;<i>Wassel</i>, <i>wassel</i>, <i>wassel</i>,&rdquo; and then the chappell (chaplain)
was to answere with a songe.&rsquo; The custom of &lsquo;toasting&rsquo;
was in full force. Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>King Henry VIII.</i>
contains several such allusions. Thus in act i., scene 4,
the king exclaims&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Let&rsquo;s be merry.</span><br />
Good my lord cardinal, I have a half a dozen healths<br />
To drink to these fair ladies.<br />
</p>

<p>Malmsey (pronounced by Shakespeare to be &lsquo;fulsom&rsquo;)
competed with sack to be the favourite drink of the
period; it was the only sweet wine specified in the ordinances
of the household of Henry VIII. Malmsey was
a strangely generic term for sweet wines from almost
every vine-growing district. Candia, Chios, Lesbos,
Tenedos, Tyre, Italy, Greece, Spain, all yielding the
<i>Malmsey</i>, which we found to have proved so fatal to</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.<br />
</p>

<p>Some believe it to have been first made at Napoli de
Malvasia, in the Morea. Certainly the principal part
of that which was so extensively imported in the
middle ages came from the Archipelago. When subject
to Venetian rule Candia and Cyprus supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Europe with their finest wines, the former island alone
being said to have exported 200,000 casks of Malmsey
annually.</p>

<p>Sack is another generic term for sweet wine,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and is
not of necessity, as Nares describes it, &lsquo;the same wine
which is now named sherry;&rsquo; a statement which the
rest of his own remarks contradict. Thus we find not
only sherry-sack, but canary-sack, Malaga-sack, rumney-sack,
palm-sack, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The derivation of the word is
much disputed; the town <i>Xique</i>, and the Spanish
<i>saco</i>, a bag, have been suggested; but <i>sack</i>, also written
<i>seck</i>, is undoubtedly the French <i>sec</i>, the Latin <i>siccus</i>,
dry. It continued a popular wine for another two
centuries, as we find from Tom D&rsquo;Urfey&rsquo;s ballad on
the &lsquo;Virtues of sack&rsquo; (1719). Redding states that the
term &lsquo;sack&rsquo; was applied to sweet and dry wines of
canary, Xeres, or Malaga. Vines are said to have been
first planted in the Canary Islands in the reign of
Charles V., imported thither from the Rhine. Canary
was much drunk formerly; the bibbers of it were dubbed
&lsquo;canary-birds,&rsquo; and the wine &lsquo;canary-sacke.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> An old
writer growls, &lsquo;sacke is their chosen nectar; they love
it better than their own souls; they will never leave off
sacke, until they have sackt out all their silver; nay, nor
then neither, for they will pawn their crouds for more
sacke.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The following receipt for beer, taken from Arnold&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Chronicle, published in 1521, reminds that by this time
hops were in use, &lsquo;ten quarters of malt, 2 of wheat, 2
of oats, with 11lbs. of hops for making 11 barrels of
single beer.&rsquo; This is the first I can find with hops as
an ingredient. The old distich, of which there are two
versions,</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Hops, reformation, bays, and beer,<br />
Came into England all in one year,<br />
</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Hops and turkeys, carp and beer,<br />
Came into England all in a year,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a><br />
</p>

<p>would fix the introduction of hops to the time of Henry
VIII. But there is a difficulty here, inasmuch as the
use of this plant in brewing was known long before, and
Henry VIII., who interfered in everything from religion
to beer-barrels, forbade his subjects to put hops in their
ale.</p>

<p>Spirits were beginning to acquire a reputation in
England. Numbers of Irish settled in Pembrokeshire in
this reign, and employed themselves in the distillation
of their national beverage, usquebaugh, which had a
large sale in this country.</p>

<p>But, to pass from the drinks to the drinkers, the
habits of Henry VIII. are well known. He was constantly
intoxicated, and kept the lowest company. His
right hand, Wolsey, was actually put in the stocks by
Sir Amias Powlett, when he was Rector of Lymington,
for drunkenness at a neighbouring fair. Why should
not such punishments be revived as either the stocks or
the &lsquo;drunkard&rsquo;s cloak&rsquo;? In this latter, drunkards were
paraded through the town, wearing a tub instead of a
cloak, a hole being made for the head to pass thro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ugh,
and two small ones in the sides, through which the
hands were drawn.</p>

<p>Experience is a good master. No one could look
after the monks better than Wolsey. It appears that a
system of <i>misericords</i> had found place in monasteries.
These misericords were exoneration from duties granted
by the Abbots to the monks. This privilege in course of
time they abused. The Augustinian canons absented
themselves from the choir and cloister, sometimes for
whole weeks; whereupon Wolsey ordered that these
canons should recreate themselves not singly, but in a
number together, supervised by the superior, and accompanied;
that they should repair not to the towns,
villages, and taverns, but to sunny places near their
houses; that they should not go to houses of laymen to
eat and drink without leave, but carry their provisions
with them.</p>

<p>One of the most magnificent pageants on record welcomed
Anne Boleyn to the city of London in 1533. At
Gracechurch Corner was erected &lsquo;the Mount Parnassus,
with the fountain of Helicon.&rsquo; It was formed of white
marble. Four streams rose an ell high and met in a
cup above the fountain which ran copiously till night with
Rhenish wine. At the great Conduit in Cheap, a fountain
ran continuously, at one end white wine, at the other
claret, all the afternoon. Anne had been maid of honour
at court. The household books of the kings describe the
allowance and rules of the table of the ladies of the
household. A marvellous picture of the times! A
chine of beef, a manchet, and a chet loaf was a breakfast
for the three. To these was added a <i>gallon of ale</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gascon wine was now in favour for court consumption.
The Losely MSS. supply the items of Sir Thomas
Carden&rsquo;s purchases for Anne of Cleves&rsquo; cellar.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Among
these were 3 hogsheads of Gascoigne wine at 3<i>l.</i> each;
10 gallons of Malmsey at 20<i>d.</i> a gallon; 11 gallons of
Muscadel at 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a gallon; and 10 gallons of sack at
16<i>d.</i> a gallon. A pipe of Gascon wine was also the bribe
which Lady Lisle sent to the Countess of Rutland, to
secure her good offices in obtaining the post of maid
of honour for her daughter, Miss Basset.</p>

<p>We are able to form a rough estimate of the quantity
of liquor kept in stock at this time, from a return which
was made by order, on the occasion of the visit of the
Emperor Charles V. to the king. The city authorities
appear to have been afraid of being drunk dry by the
swarming Flemings in the emperor&rsquo;s train. To avoid
such a calamity, a return was made of all the wine to be
found at the eleven wine merchants and the twenty-eight
principal taverns then in London; the sum total of
which was 809 pipes.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The corruptions of court life were fearlessly exposed
by a contemporary, John Skelton, in his <i>Bowge of Court</i>.
Bowge (<i>bouche</i>, mouth) denoted the courtier&rsquo;s right of
eating at the king&rsquo;s expense. The Bowge of Court was
an allegorical ship with court vices on board. Ecclesiastics
in high places were mercilessly satirised in his
<i>Colin Clout</i>, <i>e.g.</i> (<i>a</i>) their hurry from the house of God to
get drink&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But when they have once caught<br />

Yet take they cure of souls.<br />
</p>

</p>

<p>If Sir T. Elyot (1534) was correct in speaking of
temperance as a new word, the virtue was old enough,
even though the practice was rare. In the most corrupt
times virtue has ever had its witnesses, even as the epoch
of the dissolute Henry had its Sir David Lindsay, and
its Earl of Surrey. The latter, amongst <i>the means to
attain a happy life</i>, could name</p>

<p class="blockquote">

Where wine the wit may not oppress.<br />
</p>

<p>The legislation of this reign did little more than
affect details. The repeal of a certain law is worthy of
note. From a remarkable clause in a statute of Henry
III. it might be supposed that England was much
fallen from the flourishing condition of preceding times.
It had been enacted in the time of Edward II. that no
magistrate, in town or borough, who by his office ought
to keep assize, should during the continuance of his
magistracy sell, either in wholesale or retail, any wine
or victuals. This law seemed equitable in order to prevent
fraud in fixing the assize. It was in this reign
repealed. The following piece of legislation affected the
price of wines: By 23 Henry VIII., c. 7, the wines of
Gascony and Guienne were forbidden to be sold above
eightpence the gallon, and the retail price of &lsquo;Malmeseis,
romeneis, sakkes, and other swete wynes,&rsquo; was fixed at
12<i>d.</i> the gallon, 6<i>d.</i> the pottle, 3<i>d.</i> the quart, and directions
were given to the authorities &lsquo;to set the prices of
all kynde of wines in grosse.&rsquo; The merchants, however,
evaded or neglected the law and raised the price; this
aroused the vintners, who presented a remonstrance, in
answer to which it was enacted that the commissioners
appointed previously should have the discretionary power
of increasing or diminishing the prices of wines sold in
gross or by retail, as occasion should require.</p>

<p>By an Act of 1531, every brewer was forbidden to
take more than such prices and rates as should be
thought sufficient, at the discretion of Justices of Peace
within every shire, or by the mayor and sheriffs in a city.</p>

<p>An effort, only partly successful, was made at this
time to reduce holidays, which had degenerated into
occasions of excess. Complaint was made that the
number of such days was excessively increased, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
detriment of civil government and secular affairs; and
that the great irregularities and licentiousness which had
crept into these festivals by degrees, especially in the
churches, chapels, and churchyards, were found injurious
to piety, virtue, and good manners, therefore
both statutes and canons were made to regulate and restrain
them, and by an act of convocation, passed in
1536, their number was reduced.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps nothing strikes one so much in connection
with intemperance in pre-reformation time as the abuses
that gathered about religious ceremonies. Everything
of the kind was made a public occasion of excess. At
weddings especially was this notorious. Writing upon
the subject, a 16th century author observes, &lsquo;Early in
the morning the wedding people begynne to excead in
superfluous eatyng and drinkyng, and when they come to
the preachynge they are halfe droncke, some all together.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at. The court was rotten,
and its influence filtered then, as always, to the masses.
Even the pledge of temperance introduced on the continent
about this time was no safeguard. It is told how
Henry himself contrived to make an envoy of the German
court, who was an associate of a temperate order,
break his pledge, assuring him that if his master would
only visit England he would not lack boon companions.</p>

<p>Foreigners visited England. They came, they saw,
they reported. A certain Master Stephen Perlin, a
French physician who was in England just after Henry&rsquo;s
death, records for the benefit of his countrymen: &lsquo;The
English, one with the other are joyous, and are very
fond of music; they are also great drinkers. Now remember
if you please that in this country they generally
use vessels of silver when they drink wine; and they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>say to you usually at table, &ldquo;Goude chere,&rdquo; and they will
also say to you more than one hundred times, &ldquo;Drind
oui,&rdquo; and you will reply to them in their language, &ldquo;I
plaigui&rdquo; (I pledge you).&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of our own writers, Philip Stubbes, who was
ridiculed by Nash for &lsquo;pretending to anatomize abuses
and stubbe up sin by the rootes,&rsquo; asserts that the public-houses
were crowded in London from morning to night
with inveterate drunkards, whose only care appears to
have been as to where they could obtain the best ale, so
totally oblivious to all other things had they become.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>And what a flood of light is thrown not only on the
universal drinking, but upon the respectability of the
same, in the fact that a bishop, Bishop Still, a Bishop
of Bath and Wells, and previously Master of St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, and Master also of Trinity, whose
portrait still hangs in the College hall of the latter,
should be the author of the following drinking song,
which Warton calls the first Chanson à Boire <i>of any
merit</i> in our language, and apologises for introducing
a ballad convivial and <i>ungodlie</i>.</p>

</p>

<p>Is there any wonder that his &lsquo;stomacke was not
good&rsquo;? Imagine some of his successors in that See
having composed it! Fancy the author of &lsquo;Glory to
Thee, my God, this night&rsquo; (Bishop Ken), having written
it! Mark, too, the insinuation of the fourth line as to
the clergy of the period! The authorship is vouched
for by Thomas Park. The song begins the second act of
&lsquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s Needle,&rsquo; a comedy written in 1551,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>and acted at Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. Warton
mentions that in the title of the old edition it is said to
have been written &lsquo;by Mr. S., Master of Artes.&rsquo; Which,
being interpreted is, Still; <i>afterwards</i> Bishop of Bath
and Wells.</p>

<p>It was about this time that that pernicious habit
arose of <i>transacting business</i> over drink. We find constant
allusions in the Tudor period to the principal men
of the boroughs in this manner concluding a bargain.
Thus we find an entry of Mr. William Tudbold, Mayor
of Lyme, 1551, to this effect:&mdash;&rsquo;<i>Item</i>, paid at Robert
Davey&lsquo;s when we new agreed with Whytte the mason,
vi d.&rsquo;</p>

<p>These taverns were some of them kept by the clergy.
Bishop Burnet states that so pillaged were the ecclesiastics
of their property, that many clergymen were
obliged for a subsistence to turn carpenters or tailors,
and some kept ale-houses.</p>

<p>Hitherto there had been no civil legislation whatever
against drunkenness. The crime is not mentioned in
the Statute Book till the fifth year of Edward VI. From
this time we shall find a number of statutes framed for
the purpose of its prevention or punishment.</p>

<p>The Act, 5th and 6th Edward, c. 25, is entitled, &lsquo;An
Acte for Keepers of Ale-houses to be bounde by Recognizances.&rsquo;
The following is a brief epitome of the Act:&mdash;Forasmuch
as intolerable hurts and troubles to the
commonwealth do daily grow and increase through such
abuses and disorders as are had and used in common
ale-houses and other houses called tippling-houses, it is
enacted that Justices of Peace can abolish ale-houses
at their discretion, and that no tippling-house can be
opened without a licence. That these houses be supervised
by the taking surety for the maintenance of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
order and rule, and for the suppression of gaming.
Moreover, special scrutiny was made into the forfeiting
of such recognisances. Breaches of the Act were
punished with imprisonment and fine.</p>

<p>Two years later, an Act was passed to avoid the great
price and excess of wine. &lsquo;For the avoiding of many
inconveniences much evil rule and common resort of
mis-ruled persons used and frequented in many taverns,
of late newly set up in very great numbers in back lanes,
corners, and suspicious places within the city of London,
and in divers other towns and villages within this realm,&rsquo;
it was enacted, subject to certain exceptions of rank and
income, that none should be allowed to keep any vessel
of Gascony, Guienne, or Rochelle wine for the use of
his family exceeding 10 gallons under forfeiture of 10<i>l.</i>;
none could be retailed without a licence, and only two
taverns could be licensed in a borough, with the following
exceptions, forty in London, three in Westminster,
six in Bristol, four in Canterbury, Cambridge, Chester,
Exeter, Gloucester, Hull, Newcastle, and Norwich; three
in Colchester, Hereford, Ipswich, Lincoln, Oxford, Salisbury,
Shrewsbury, Southampton, Winchester, and Worcester.
The retail price was fixed, and none could retail
wines to be drunk within their respective houses.</p>

<p>Vastly important was this legislation; its consequences
were manifest, and would have been much more
so, had not so much of it been permitted to become a
dead letter. At any rate it paved the way for the very
important Act of Philip and Mary in the Irish Parliament
which renders obligatory a licence for the manufacture
of Aqua Vitæ, and which brought about so great
a reduction in the use of ardent spirits in that country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The consort of Queen Mary soon found out the
favourite English drink. Philip courted popularity.
He gave it out that he was come to England to live
like an Englishman, and in proof thereof drank some
ale for the first time at a public dinner, gravely commending
it as the wine of the country. Queen Mary at
the time of her coronation was single, so Philip missed
the usual pageant, the running of the conduits at Cornhill
and Cheapside with wine, and the oration at St.
Paul&rsquo;s School, of Heywood, the Queen&rsquo;s favourite poet,
who &lsquo;sat under a vine.&rsquo; It is to be hoped that Heywood
made himself more intelligible than in some of his enigmatical
epigrams, of which that on &lsquo;Measure&rsquo; is a specimen.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Measure is a merry meane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which filde with noppy drinke,</span><br />
When merry drinkers, drinke off clene.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then merrily they winke.</span><br />
<br />
Measure is a merry meane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I meane measures gret,</span><br />
Where lippes to litely pitchers weane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those lippes they scantly wet.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The pastoral visit of Bishop Ridley to Queen Mary
reminds us of a curious feature of old English hospitality,
that of drinking before leaving. Persons of quality were
either taken into the cellar for a draught of ale or wine
fresh from the cask, as was the Duke of Buckingham
into Wolsey&rsquo;s cellar, or it was brought to them last
thing as they mounted their horses, and was called from
this the stirrup-cup.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Boy, lead our horses on when we get up,<br />
Wee&rsquo;l have with you a merry <i>stirrup cupp</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Ridley was introduced to the cellar by Sir Thomas
Wharton, the steward of the household. When he had
drunk, he said he had done wrong to drink under a roof
where God&rsquo;s Word was rejected.</p>

<p>The opinions that have been ventured upon the relative
sobriety of the Elizabethan period are as conflicting
as they are various. The most reliable contemporary
who can be cited in favour of the sobriety of the period
is William Harrison, whose opinion may be gathered
from two passages of his work. He says, &lsquo;I might here
talke somewhat of the great silence that is used at the
tables of the honourable and wiser sort generallie over
all the realme, likewise the moderate eating and drinking
that is daily seene, and finallie of the regard that
such one hath to keepe himselfe from note of surfetting
and drunkennesse (for which cause salt meat, except
beefe, bacon, and porke, are not anie whit esteemed, and
yet these three may be much powdered). But as in the
rehearsall thereof I should commend the nobleman,
merchant, and frugall artificer, so I could not cleare the
meaner sort of husbandmen of verie much bobbling (except
it be here and there some od yeoman), with whom
he is thought to be the meriest that talketh of most
ribaldraie, or the wisest man that speakest fastest among
them, and now and then surfeiting and drunkennesse,
which they rather fall into for want of heed-taking, than
wilfullie following or delighting in those errours of set
mind and purpose. It may be that divers of them living
at home with hard and pinching diet, small drinks, and
some of them having scarce enough of that, are soonest
overtaken when they come unto such banquets, howbeit
they take it generallie as no small disgrace if they happen
to be cup-shotten, so that is a grefe unto them, though
now <i>sans remédie</i> sith the thing is done and pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>t.&rsquo; The
passage that follows certainly suggests that in some
respects our ancestors were wiser than their descendants:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Drink is usually filled in goblets, jugs, bols of silver, in noblemen&rsquo;s
houses, all of which notwithstanding are seldom set upon
the table, but each one, as necessitie urgeth, calleth for a cup of
such drinke as him listeth to drinke: so that, when he have tasted
of it, he delyvereth the cup againe to some of the standers bye,
who, making it cleane by pouring out the drinke that remayneth,
restoreth it to the cupboard from whence he fetched the same. By
this device much idle tippling is cut off; for if the full pots shall
continuallie stand at the elbowe or near the trencher, divers will
alwaies be dealing with them, whereas they now drinke seldome,
and onelie when necessitie urgeth, and so avoid the note of grete-drynkinge
or often troubling the servitors with filling their bolls.</p></div>

<p>But there is a vast mass of evidence on the other
side that must be examined before the conflicting judgments
can be put into the scale. And first, the preambles
to the Acts of Parliament testify that
the national taste was intensifying. Thus the preamble
to Act 1 Eliz. c. ii. states that of late years much greater
quantity of sweet wines had been imported into the kingdom
than had been usual in former times. Again, in
1597, an Act was passed to restrain the excessive use of
malt. The preamble asserts that greater quantity of
malt is daily made than either in times past or now is
needful. It must be remembered, however, that during
the time of Elizabeth the <i>export</i> of beer had become a
valuable branch of commerce. The queen herself, in
her right of purveyance, a prerogative then inherent in
the crown, caused quantities of beer so obtained to be
sold on the Continent for her own emolument. Further
than this, honest efforts were made in some directions
to keep down the home consumption. For instance, it
is stated the Lord Keeper Egerton, in his charge to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
judges when going on circuit in 1602, bade them ascertain,
for the queen&rsquo;s information, how many ale-houses
the justices of the peace had pulled down, so that the
good justices might be rewarded and the evil removed.</p>

<p>One more Act of this reign must be noticed, the exact
or full purport of which might be mistaken. It was
nominally against the danger of fire, but in reality it
was intended to prevent tipplers from having the means
of conducting furtive brewings. The Act bears the date
of 1590. By 22 Eliz. it was enacted &lsquo;that no innkeeper,
common brewer, or typler shall keep in their houses any
fewel, as straw or verne, which shall not be thought
requisite, and being warned of the constable to rid the
same within one day, <i>subp&oelig;na</i>, xx<i>s</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the next place we must take into account the
extraordinary <i>variety</i> of wines now drunk. Holinshed
observes, &lsquo;As all estates doo exceed herin, I meane for
number of costlie dishes, so these forget not to use the
like excesse in wine, insomuch as there is no kind to be
had, whereof at great meetings there is not some store
to be had&rsquo; (Holinshed, <i>Chronicles</i>). The writer further
speaks of the importation of 20,000 or 30,000 tuns a year,
notwithstanding the constant restraints put upon it.
After detailing about fifty-six sorts of &lsquo;small wines,&rsquo; such
as claret, &amp;c., he speaks of &lsquo;the thirtie kinds of Italian,
Grecian, Spanish, Canarian, &amp;c., whereof vernage (a sweet
Italian wine, so called from the thick-skinned grape or
<i>vernaccia</i> used in its manufacture), cate, piment (vin cuit),
raspis, muscadell, romnie, bastard, tire (Italian, from the
grape <i>tirio</i>), oseie, caprike, clarcie, and malmeseie, are
not least of all accompted of because of their strength
and valure.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>The monasteries were noted for having the best wine
and ale, the latter of which they specially brewed for
themselves. The author just quoted mentions that the
best wine was called <i>theologicum</i>, because it was had
&lsquo;from the cleargie and religious men, unto whose houses
manie of the laitie would often send for bottels filled
with the same, being sure that they would neither drinke
nor be served of the worst, or such as was anie waies
mingled or brued by the vintner. Naie, the merchant
would have thought that his soule should have gone
streight waie to the devill, if he should have served them
with other than the best.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Besides all these kinds of wines, of which the
strongest were most in request, distilled liquors were
manufactured in England, the principal of which were
rosa solis and aqua vitæ. Ale and beer were also in
request. There was single beer, or small ale, and double
beer, also double-double beer, dagger ale, and bracket.
But the favourite drink was a kind of ale called huf-cap,
which was highly intoxicating; thus in Harrison&rsquo;s
<i>England</i> we read, &lsquo;These men hale at huf-cap till they
be red as cockes, and little wiser than their combs.&rsquo;
And again, the <i>Water Poet</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
There&rsquo;s one thing more I had almost forgot,<br />
And this is it, of ale-houses and innes,<br />
Wine marchants, vintners, brewers, who much wins<br />
By others losing, I say more or lesse,<br />
Who sale of <i>huf-cap</i> liquor doe professe.<br />
</p>

<p>This drink (huf-cap) was also called mad-dog, angels&rsquo;
food, and dragon&rsquo;s milk. The gentry brewed for their
own consumption a generous ale which they did not
bring to table till it was two years old. This was called
<i>March Ale</i>, from the month in which it was brewed.
Al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>e was often richly compounded with various dainties.
Often it was warmed, and mixed with sugar and spices;
sometimes with a toast; sometimes with a roasted crab
or apple, making the beverage known as <i>Lamb&rsquo;s wool</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Sometimes lurk I in a gossip&rsquo;s bowl,<br />
In very likeness of a roasted crab;<br />
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,<br />
And on her wither&rsquo;d dew-lap pour the ale.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><br />
</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now crowne the bowle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gentle <i>lambs-wooll</i>,</span><br />
Add sugar, and nutmegs, and ginger.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The strength of the ale as commonly sold transpires
from many incidental notices in the history of the time.
Thus Leicester writes to Burleigh that at a certain place
in her Majesty&rsquo;s travels &lsquo;there was not one drop of
good drink for her.... We were fain to send forthwith
to London, and to Kenilworth, and divers other places
where ale was; her own here was so strong as there was
no man able to drink it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The sobriety of this queen has never been called in
question, although one author, in commenting on the
Kenilworth pageant, remarks that many such entertainments
were accepted by this queen, who professed to
restrain luxury and extravagance, and issued sumptuary
edicts, but did not ennoble precept by example. This is
ill-natured. It is incidental to high position to accept
a profusion of hospitality, for which it can scarcely be
held responsible. And unquestionably on this occasion
the hospitality was profuse. It is stated that no less
than 365 hogsheads of beer were drunk at it, in addition
to the daily complement of 16 hogsheads of wine. The
entertainment lasted nineteen days. Notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>such exceptional receptions, there is no doubt that the
queen did bring influence to bear in refining the manners
of her court; and among the many changes effected,
none were more apparent than in the festive entertainments
of the time. Harrison draws particular attention
to the fact that the swarms of jesters, tumblers, and
harpers, that formerly had been indispensable to the
banquet-room, were now discarded. He further mentions
another valuable change of custom. The wine and other
liquors were not placed upon the tables with the dishes,
but on a sideboard, and each person called as occasion
required for a flagon of the wine he wanted, by which
means &lsquo;much idle tippling was avoided.&rsquo; When the
company had done feeding, what remained was sent to
the servants, and when these were satisfied the fragments
were distributed among the poor who waited
without the gate.</p>

<p>To the minstrel these innovations were practically
ruin. He who had been in past times the soul of the
tournament, and a welcome guest at every banquet, was
now a street ballad-singer, or ale-house fiddler, chanting
forth from benches and barrel-heads to an audience
consisting of a few gaping rustics, or a parcel of idle
boys; and, as if the degradation of these despised and
unhoused favourites of former days had not been enough,
the stern justice of the law made them doubly vile,
obliging them to skulk into corners, and perform their
merry offices in fear and trembling. Minstrels were now
classed in the statute with rogues and vagabonds, and
made liable to the same pains and penalties. Already
it might be said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
No longer courted and caress&rsquo;d,<br />
High placed in hall, a welcome guest,<br />
He pour&rsquo;d, to lord and lady gay,<br />
The unpremeditated lay:<br />
Old times were changed, old manners gone.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a><br />
</p>

<p>What has just been observed of the queen, applies
to more than one of her renowned courtiers. Burleigh
was a man given to hospitality, occasionally to conviviality,
if there is any truth in the lines known as
<i>The Islington Garland</i>, which thus describes him and his
friend,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Here gallant gay Essex, and burly Lord Burleigh,<br />
Sate late at their revels, and came to them early,<br />
</p>

<p>alluding to the inn at Islington. But rather than read
the man in an ephemeral lampoon we would turn to
his sole literary production, and find the impress of his
mind in his work addressed to his son Robert Cecil,
entitled <i>Precepts or Directions for the Well Ordering and
Carriage of a Man&rsquo;s Life</i>, in which he offers the following
advice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Touching the guiding of thy house, let thy hospitality be
moderate, and, according to the means of thy estate, rather plentiful
than sparing, but not costly. For I never knew any man grow
poor by keeping an orderly table. But some consume themselves
through secret vices, and their hospitality bears the blame. But
banish swinish drunkards out of thine house, which is a vice impairing
health, consuming much and makes no show. I never
heard praise ascribed to the drunkard, but for the well-bearing of
his drink, which is a better commendation for a brewer&rsquo;s horse or
a drayman, than for either a gentleman or a serving-man.</p></div>

<p>A more striking lay homily than even this upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>evils of drink is to be found in the writings of another
notable of the period, Sir Walter Raleigh. His words
are letters of gold.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Take especial care that thou delight not in wine, for there was
not any man that came to honour or preferment that loved it; for
it transformeth a man into a beast, decayeth health, poisoneth the
breath, destroyeth natural heat, brings a man&rsquo;s stomach to an
artificial heat, deformeth the face, rotteth the teeth, and, to conclude,
maketh a man contemptible, soon old, and despised of all
wise and worthy men; hated in thy servants, in thyself, and
companions; for it is a bewitching and infectious vice. A
drunkard will never shake off the delight of beastliness; for the
longer it possesses a man, the more he will delight in it; and the
older he groweth, the more he will be subject to it; for it dulleth
the spirits, and destroyeth the body, as ivy doth the old tree; or
as the worm that engendereth in the kernel of a nut. Take heed,
therefore, that such a cureless canker pass not thy youth, nor such
a beastly infection thy old age; for then shall all thy life be but as
the life of a beast, and after thy death thou shalt only leave a
shameful infamy to thy posterity, who shall study to forget that
such a one was their father.</p></div>

<p>Such is the language of the man who founded the
&lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; in Bread Street, the first of the long succession
of clubs started in London,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and connected with
which were such as Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont,
and Fletcher. And, coming from such a man, it is
convincing that the vitiation of the national taste had
forced itself upon common observation, and, of course,
engraved itself upon the pages of history. Thus Camden,
speaking of the year 1581 (though the earlier part
of his observation displays imperfect acquaintance with
previous history), remarks, &lsquo;The English, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
hitherto, of all the Northern nations, shown themselves
the least addicted to immoderate drinking, and been
commended for their sobriety, first learned in these
wars with the Netherlands to swallow a large quantity
of intoxicating liquor, and to destroy their own health
by drinking that of others.&rsquo; And as a confirmation of
the <i>latter</i> part of his assertion, it may be noticed that
the barbarous terms formerly used in drinking matches
are of Dutch, German, or Danish origin.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>To the same effect the chronicler Baker observes
that during the Dutch war the English learnt to be
drunkards, and brought the vice so far to overspread the
kingdom that laws were fain to be enacted for repressing
it. The satirist Tom Nash, who lived at this time,
describes, as only he could, the various <i>classes of drunkards</i>
as they presented themselves to his observation:&mdash;&lsquo;The
first is <i>ape-drunk</i>, and he leaps and sings and hollows
and danceth for the heavens; the second is <i>lyon-drunk</i>,
and he flings the pot about the house, breaks the glass
windows with his dagger, and is apt to quarrel....
The third is <i>swine-drunk</i>, heavy, lumpish, and sleepy,
and cries for a little more drink and a few more clothes;
the fourth is <i>sheep-drunk</i>, wise in his own conceit when
he cannot bring forth a right word; the fifth is <i>maudlen-drunk</i>,
when a fellow will weep for kindness in the midst
of his drink.... The sixth is <i>martin-drunk</i>, when a
man is drunk, and drinks himself sober ere he stir. The
seventh is <i>goat-drunk</i>, when in his drunkenness he hath
no mind but on lechery. The eighth is <i>fox-drunk</i>, as
many of the Dutchmen be, which will never bargain but
when they are drunk. All these species, and more, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have seen <i>practised</i> in one company and at one sitting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The various methods of raising money for the Church
and poor have already been examined under the heading
of <i>Ales</i>. It will be necessary in forming the estimate of
manners at this time to trace how the system developed,
The use and abuse will be both apparent. For the
use we turn to the <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> where we read
that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For the church ale two young men of the parish are yearely chosen
by their last pregoers to be wardens, who, dividing the task, make
collections among the parishioners of what provision it pleaseth them
voluntarily to bestow. This they employ in brewing, baking, and
other achates against Whitsuntide, upon which holy dayes the
neighbours meet at the church-house, and there meetly feed on
theire owne victuals, contributing some petty portion to the stock
which by many smalls groweth to a meetly greatness, for there is
entertained a kinde of emulation between the wardens, who by his
graciousness in gathering, and good husbandry in expending, can
best advance the churches profit. Besides, the neighbour parishes
at those times lovingly visit one another, and this way frankly
spend their money together. When the feast is ended the wardens
yield in their account to the parishioners, and such money as
exceedeth the disbursements is layd up in store to defray any
extraordinary charges arising in the parish or imposed on them for
the good of the country, or the prince&rsquo;s service.</p></div>

<p>The next author to be cited gives both use and abuse;
thus Philip Stubs (or Stubbes), who has been already
quoted, after speaking of the contributions of malt by
parishioners for church-ales, goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When this nippitatum (strong liquor), this huffe-cap as they
call it, this nectar of life, is set abroach, well is he that can get the
soonest to it, and spends the most at it, for he is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>counted the
godliest man of all the rest, and most in God&rsquo;s favour, because it
is spent upon his church forsooth. If all be true which they say,
they bestow that money which is got thereby for the repaire of
their churches and chappels; they buy bookes for the service, cupps
for the celebration of the sacrament, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Speaking of the manner of keeping wakes, he says
they were the sources of &lsquo;gluttonie and drunkenness,&rsquo;
and that many spend more at one of these than in all
the year besides.</p>

<p>For the unqualified abuse of such a system we turn
to a sermon preached in the same reign (1570) at Blandford
by William Kethe, from which it appears that these
church-ales were kept on the Sunday, &lsquo;which holy day,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;the multitudes call their revelyng day, which
day is spent in bul-beatings, beare-beatings, bowlings,
dicyng, cardyng, daunsynges, drunkenness, and whoredome.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Even this picture is utterly eclipsed by the ghastly
description of the excesses at a church dedication festival,
as given by the contemporary Naogeorgus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The dedication of the church is yerely had in minde,<br />
With worship passing catholicke, and in a wond&rsquo;rous kinde;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
Then sundrie pastimes do begin, and filthy daunces oft;<br />
When drunkards they do lead the daunce with fray and bloody fight,<br />
That handes and eares and head and face are torne in wofull plight.<br />
The streames of bloud runne downe the armes, and oftentimes is seene<br />
The carkasse of some ruffian slaine is left upon the greene.<br />
Here many for their lovers sweete some dainty thing do true,<br />
And many to the taverne goe and drinke for companie,<br />
Whereat they foolish songs do sing, and noyses great do make;<br />
Some in the meanewhile play at cardes, and some the dice do shake.<br />
Their custome also is the priest into the house to pull,<br />
Whom, when they have, they thinke their game accomplished at full;<br />
He farre in noyse exceedes them all, and eke in drinking drye<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>The cuppes, a prince he is.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Such a description is of itself an ample justification
of the censure of the clergy in the injunctions of Elizabeth,
among which we find: &lsquo;The clergy shall not haunt
ale-houses or taverns, or spend their time idly at dice,
cards, tables, or any other unlawful game.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But amidst all these dissipated distractions, influences
of a qualifying character were also at work. The powerful
pen of Bacon was writing, &lsquo;All the crimes on the
earth do not destroy so many of the human race, nor
alienate so much property, as drunkenness.&rsquo; George
Gascoigne was holding up an honest old-fashioned mirror,
true as steel, to the faults and vices of his countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
In his curious treatise, the full title of which is
&lsquo;<i>A Delicate Diet for Daintie Mouthde Droonkards; wherein
the fowle abuse of common carousing and quaffing with
heartie draughtes, is honestly admonished</i>,&rsquo; he vigorously
inveighs against the popular drinks: &lsquo;We must have
March Beere, dooble-dooble Beere, Dagger-Ale, Bragget,
Renish wine, White-wine, French wine, Gascoyne wine,
Sack, Hollocke, Canaria wine, Vino Greco, Vinum amabile,
and al the wines that may be gotten. Yea, wine of itselfe
is not sufficient; but Sugar, Limons, and sundry sortes of
spices must be drowned therein.&rsquo; Spenser was teaching
the virtues of temperance in that marvellous production
in which chivalry and religion are so matchlessly blended,
his <i>Faery Queen</i>. The second book contains the legend
of Sir Guyon, or of Temperance. The knight is sent
upon an adventure by the Fairy Queen, to bring captive
to her court an enchantress named Acrasia, in whom is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>imaged the vice of Intemperance. The various adventures
which he meets with by the way are such as show
the virtues and happy effects of temperance, or the ill
consequences of intemperance. But before claiming for
the sons of Rechab a patron in Spenser, it must be told
that the same author in his <i>Epithalamion</i> harps on other
strings. There we read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Pour out the wine without restraint or stay,<br />
Pour not by cups but by the bellyful.<br />
Pour out to all that wull,<br />
And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine,<br />
That they may sweat and drunken be withal.<br />
</p>

<p>These are dissimilar strains to those of the good Sir
Guyon,</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In whom great rule of Temperance goodly doth appear.<br />
</p>

<p>And shall we here stop short? Certainly not. The
Bard of Avon, William Shakespeare, offers many a caution
to the falling and fallen. To attempt to quote him
fully would be beside the present purpose. It must
suffice to gather from his works five or six prominent
reflections.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>I. The constant use of strong drink impairs its
<i>remedial</i> effect.</p>

<p>Thus in the <i>Tempest</i>, act ii. scene 3, Stephano is
made to say, &lsquo;He shall taste of my bottle; if he have
never drank wine afore, it will go near to remove
his fit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>II. That strict temperance is a source of health.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus in <i>As You Like It</i>, act ii. scene 3, Adam
declares&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;<br />
For in my youth I never did apply<br />
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,<br />
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<br />
The means of weakness and debility;<br />
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,<br />
Frosty, but kindly.<br />
</p>

<p>III. That the Danes had an established character for
deep drinking. Thus <i>Hamlet</i>, act i. scene 4:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<i>Hamlet.</i> The king doth awake to-night and takes his rouse,<br />
Keeps wassel, and the swaggering upspring reels;<br />
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,<br />
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out<br />
The triumph of his pledge.<br />
<br />
<i>Hor.</i> Is it a custom?<br />
<br />
<i>Ham.</i> Ay, marry, is&rsquo;t;<br />
But to my mind&mdash;though I am native here<br />
And to the manner born&mdash;it is a custom<br />
More honour&rsquo;d in the breach than the observance.<br />
This heavy-headed revel, east and west,<br />
Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations:<br />
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br />
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br />
From our achievements, though perform&rsquo;d at height,<br />
The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br />
</p>

<p>&lsquo;They clepe us drunkards.&rsquo; And well our Englishmen
might, for in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time there was a
<i>Dane</i> in London, of whom the following mention is
made in a collection of characters, entitled <i>Looke to it,
for Ile stab ye</i> (no date):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
You that will drinke <i>Keynaldo</i> unto deth,<br />
The <i>Dane</i> that would carouse out of his boote.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W. Mason adds that &lsquo;it appears from one of
Howell&rsquo;s letters, dated at Hamburg in the year 1632,
that the then King of Denmark had not degenerated
from his jovial predecessor. In his account of an entertainment
given by his majesty to the Earl of Leicester,
he tells us that the king, after beginning thirty-five
toasts, was carried away in his chair, and that all the
officers of the court were drunk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>See also the <i>Nugæ Antiquæ</i>, vol. ii. p. 133, for the
scene of drunkenness introduced into the court of James I.
by the King of Denmark in 1606.</p>

<p>Roger Ascham, in one of his letters, mentions being
present at an entertainment where the Emperor of
Germany seemed in drinking to rival the King of Denmark:
&lsquo;The emperor,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;drank the best that
ever I saw; he had his head in the glass five times as
long as any of us, and never drank less than a good
quart at once of Rhenish wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>IV. That Shakespeare regarded English drunkenness
as influenced by our intercourse with the Low Countries.
Thus, <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, act ii. scene 2, Mistress
Page calls Falstaff a <i>Flemish drunkard</i>. The Variorum
Edition of 1803 has the following note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is not without reason that this term of reproach is here
used. Sir John Smythe, in <i>Certain Discourses, &amp;c.</i>, 4to. 1590,
says that &lsquo;the habit of drinking to excess was introduced into
England from the low countries by some of our such men of
warre within these very few years, whereof it is come to passe,
that now-a-dayes there are very fewe feastes where our said
men of warre are present, but that they do invite and procure all
the companie, of what calling soever they be, to carowsing and
quaffing; and, because they will not be denied their challenges,
they, with many new conges, ceremonies, and reverences, drinke to
the health of counsellors, and unto the health of their greatest
friends both at home and abroad, in which exercise they never
cease till they be deade drunke, or, as the <i>Flemings</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> say, <i>doot
drunken</i>.&rsquo; He adds, &lsquo;And this aforesaid detestable vice hath,
within these six or seven yeares, taken wonderful roote amongst
our English nation, that in times past was wont to be of all other
nations of christendome one of the soberest.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>V. That whatever the Danes were, the English were
worse.</p>

<p>In <i>Othello</i> we have a terrible reputation. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Act ii. scene 3. The double-dyed Iago has tempted
honest foolish Cassio to drink with him, in spite of
Cassio&rsquo;s very honest confession, &lsquo;I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy
would invent some other custom of entertainment.&rsquo; But
Cassio is weak. On Iago&rsquo;s urgent pressing, he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
do it; but it dislikes me.&rsquo; He had just before remarked,
&lsquo;I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it
makes here [<i>striking his forehead</i>]: I am unfortunate in
the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They passed to the revel. Iago, who is seasoned,
calls out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Some wine, ho!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And let me the canakin clink, clink;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And let me the canakin clink:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">A soldier&rsquo;s a man;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">A life&rsquo;s but a span;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Why, then, let a soldier drink.</span><br />
Some wine, boys.                   [<i>Wine brought in.</i><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Cassio.</i> &lsquo;Fore heaven, an excellent song.</p>

<p><i>Iago.</i> I learned it in England, where (indeed) they are most
potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied
Ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>llander,&mdash;Drink, oh!&mdash;are nothing to your English.</p>

<p><i>Cassio.</i> Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?</p>

<p><i>Iago.</i> Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk;
he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander
a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.</p>

<p><i>Cassio.</i> To the health of our general!</p>

<p><i>Mon.</i> I am for it, lieutenant, and I&rsquo;ll do you justice.</p>

<p><i>Iago.</i> <i>O sweet England!</i></p></div>

<p>How like is human nature at all periods! Iago&rsquo;s
drinking song reminds us of the half-gay, half-melancholy
campaigning song, said to have been composed by
General Wolfe, and sung by him at the mess-table on
the eve of the storming of Quebec, in which he fell so
gloriously:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Why, soldiers, why<br />
Should we be melancholy, boys?<br />
Why, soldiers, why,<br />
Whose business &lsquo;tis to die?<br />
For should next campaign<br />
Send us to Him who made us, boys,<br />
We&rsquo;re free from pain;<br />
But should we remain,<br />
<i>A bottle and kind landlady</i><br />
Will set all right again.<br />
</p>

<p>This song was a favourite with Sir Walter Scott&mdash;see
Washington Irving&rsquo;s <i>Abbotsford and Newstead</i>.</p>

<p>VI. The bane of ardent spirits and of that to which
they conduce&mdash;intemperance. Thus <i>Othello</i>, act ii.
scene 3:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>O, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, revel, pleasure, and applause,
transform ourselves into beasts!</p></div>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known
by, let us call thee&mdash;devil!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>And&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil.</p></div>

<p>Two customs which are alluded to in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works are worthy of note. <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, act
ii. scene 2.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Bard.</i> Sir John, there&rsquo;s one Master Brook below would fain
speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath sent your
worship a morning&rsquo;s draught of sack.</p></div>

<p>According to Malone, it seems to have been a common
custom at taverns, in our author&rsquo;s time, to send
presents of wine from one room to another, either as a
memorial of friendship, or (as in the present instance)
by way of introduction to acquaintance. Of the existence
of this practice the following anecdote of Ben
Jonson and Bishop Corbet furnishes a proof: Ben
Jonson was at a tavern, and in comes Bishop Corbet
(but not so then) into the next room. Ben Jonson calls
for a quart of <i>raw</i> wine, and gives it to the tapster.
&ldquo;Sirrah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;carry this to the gentleman in the
next chamber, and tell him, I sacrifice my service to
him.&rdquo; The fellow did, and in those words. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo;
says Dr. Corbet, &ldquo;I thank him for his love; but &lsquo;pr&rsquo;ythe
tell him from me that he is mistaken; for <i>sacrifices</i> are
always <i>burnt</i>&rdquo;&rsquo; (<i>Merry Passages and Jeasts</i>, MSS. Harl.
6395).</p>

<p>This practice was continued as late as the Restoration.
In the Parliamentary History, vol. xxii. p. 114, we have
the following passage from Dr. Price&rsquo;s <i>Life of General
Monk</i>: &lsquo;I came to the <i>Three Tuns</i> before Guildhall,
where the general had quartered two nights before. I
entered the tavern with a servant and portmanteau, and
asked for a room, which I had scarce got into, <i>but wine
followed me as a present</i> from some citizens, desiring leave
to drink their morning&rsquo;s draught with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other custom to be noted is that of taking <i>night-caps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></i>.
<i>Macbeth</i>, act i. scene 2.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Lady Macbeth.</i> I have drugged their possets.</p></div>

<p>It appears from this passage as well as from many
others in our old dramatic performances, that it was the
general custom to take <i>possets</i> just before bed-time. So
in the first part of <i>King Edward IV.</i>, by Heywood:
&lsquo;thou shalt be welcome to beef and bacon, and perhaps
a bag-pudding; and my daughter Nell shall pop a <i>posset</i>
upon thee when thou goest to bed.&rsquo; Macbeth has already
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Go bid thy mistress, when my <i>drink</i> is ready,<br />
She strike upon the bell.<br />
</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth has also just observed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
That which hath made them drunk, hath made me bold.<br />
</p>

<p>And in <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> Mrs. Quickly
promises Jack Rugby a <i>posset</i> at night. This custom is
also mentioned by Froissart.</p>

<p>One more quotation I cannot refrain from adding.
It is not from Shakespeare, but from one who had
studied him, and who, if nothing else, could certainly
parody the &lsquo;seven ages of man&rsquo; (<i>As You Like It</i>, act ii.
scene 7).</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="smcap">Stages of Drunkenness.</span>&mdash;All the world&rsquo;s a pub,<br />
And all the men and women merely drinkers;<br />
They have their hiccoughs and their staggerings;<br />
And one man in a day drinks many glasses,<br />
His acts being seven stages. At first the gentleman,<br />
Steady and steadfast in his good resolves;<br />
And then the wine and bitters, appetiser,<br />
And pining, yearning look, leaving like a snail<br />
The comfortable bar. And then the arguments,<br />
Trying like Hercules with a wrathful frontage<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>To refuse one more two penn&rsquo;orth. Then the mystified,<br />
Full of strange thoughts, unheeding good advice,<br />
Careless of honour, sudden, thick, and gutt&rsquo;ral,<br />
Seeking the troubled repetition<br />
Even in the bottle&rsquo;s mouth; and then quite jovial,<br />
In fair good humour while the world swims round<br />
With eyes quite misty, while his friends him cut,<br />
Full of nice oaths and awful bickerings;<br />
And so he plays his part. The sixth stage shifts<br />
Into the stupid, slipping, drunken man,<br />
With &lsquo;blossoms&rsquo; on his nose and bleery-eyed,<br />
His shrunken face unshaved, from side to side<br />
He rolls along; and his unmanly voice,<br />
Huskier than ever, fails and flies,<br />
And leaves him&mdash;staggering round. Last scene of all,<br />
That ends this true and painful history,<br />
Is stupid childishness, and then oblivion&mdash;<br />
Sans watch, sans chain, sans coin, sans everything.<br />
</p>

<p>It is impossible to dismiss Shakespeare without some
notice of the man himself. But how little is known
apart from his works!<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Go to Stratford-on-Avon, visit
&lsquo;the birthplace;&rsquo; bear those good ladies who show it
tell you of the eight villages immortalised by their supposed
connection with the poet; hear them repeat the
lines ascribed by tradition to Shakespeare himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Piping Pebworth, dancing Marston,<br />
Haunted Hillborough, hungry Grafton,<br />
Dudging Exhall, Popish Wickford,<br />
Beggarly Broom, and drunken Bidford.<br />
</p>

<p>Hear them tell the story of Shakespeare&rsquo;s crab-tree,
how that the young poet was one of a party who accepted
a challenge for a drinking bout from certain topers at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Bidford, how that the hero became so overcome that
when he started home he could proceed no further than
the crab-tree, and so lay down there and sheltered for
the night.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Hear, too, of &lsquo;y<sup>e</sup> Falcon Tavern,&rsquo; close to
the grammar school where the poet was almost certainly
educated. And this is all that the present limit allows.</p>

<p>How died he? We turn to the pages of an inimitable
diary, and read thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>After this act (referring to the making of his will) we surmise
the poet&rsquo;s strength rallied, his friends probably heard of his
illness, and crowded around him.... Then came Ben Jonson
and Drayton, his chosen ones&mdash;they shared his inmost heart. In
the city, on the stage, at good men&rsquo;s feasts.... Their minds had
been as one. Shakespeare was sick, and they came to cheer, to
sooth, to sympathize with his sufferings. Animated and excited
by their long-tried and much-loved society, as the sound of the
trumpet rouses the spirit of the dying war-horse, their presence and
voices made him forget the weakness that even then was bowing
him to the very dust. He left his chamber, and perhaps quitted
his bed to join the circle; we think we hear him, with musical
voice, exclaim, &lsquo;Sick now! droop now!&rsquo; We imagine we behold
his pale face flushed with the brilliant animation of happiness, but
not of health. We see his eyes flashing with the rays of genius,
and sparkling with sentiments of unmingled pleasure. He is himself
again, the terrors of death are passed away, the festive banquet
is spread, and the warm grasp of friendly hands have driven the
thick coming fancies from his lightened heart; he is the life of the
party, the spirit of the feasts; but the exertion was far too great
for his fragile frame, &lsquo;the choice of death is rare,&rsquo; and the destroyer
quitted not his splendid victim.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p></div>

<p>So passed away William Shakespeare, whose influence
cannot be better summed up than in the words of a very
thoughtful writer:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>In all his works he is a witness ever ready to declare and
expose the ruling sin of his day and generation. It is true that he
sometimes found a picture gallery among the drunkards, used them
in his artistic way, and made them extol the virtues of the thing
that lowered them to what they were, the buffoons of his creation;
but in his heart of hearts, as he would himself express it, he
abhorred the thing, while he could not resist the acknowledgment
of its fascination.</p></div>

<p>The same cannot be said of his friend, Ben Jonson,
who, like so many of the dramatists of the period, as
Marlowe, Greene, and Nash, was a notoriously free liver.
His naturally passionate disposition, so unlike that of
his famous friend, was rendered more hasty and vindictive
by his addiction to drink. He goes near to condemn
himself in his apostrophe &lsquo;To Penshurst&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Whose liberal board doth flow</span><br />
With all that hospitality doth know!<br />
Where comes no guest but is allowed to eat<br />
Without his fear, and of my lord&rsquo;s own meat;<br />
Where the same beer and bread, and self-same wine,<br />
That is his lordship&rsquo;s shall be also mine.<br />
And I not fain to sit&mdash;as some this day<br />
At great men&rsquo;s tables&mdash;and yet dine away.<br />
Here no man tells my cups.<br />
</p>

<p>To him canary was</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The very elixir and spirit of wine.<br />
</p>

<p>He could say, though not in the original intention,</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Wine is the word that glads the heart of man,<br />
And mine&rsquo;s the house of wine. Sack, says my bush,<br />
Be merry and drink sherry, that is my posie.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ben Jonson&rsquo;s Sociable Rules for the Apollo.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Let none but guests, or clubbers, hither come.<br />
Let dunces, fools, sad sordid men keep home.<br />
Let learned, civil, merry men, b&rsquo;invited,<br />
And modest too; nor be choice ladies slighted.<br />
Let nothing in the treat offend the guests;<br />
More for delight than cost prepare the feast.<br />
The cook and purvey&rsquo;r must our palates know;<br />
And none contend who shall sit high or low.<br />
Our waiters must quick-sighted be, and dumb,<br />
And let the drawers quickly hear and come.<br />
Let not our wine be mix&rsquo;d, but brisk and neat,<br />
Or else the drinkers may the vintners beat.<br />
And let our only emulation be,<br />
Not drinking much, but talking wittily.<br />
Let it be voted lawful to stir up<br />
Each other with a moderate chirping cup;<br />
Let not our company be or talk too much;<br />
On serious things, or sacred, let&rsquo;s not touch<br />
With sated heads and bellies. Neither may<br />
Fiddlers unask&rsquo;d obtrude themselves to play,<br />
With laughing, leaping, dancing, jests, and songs,<br />
And whate&rsquo;er else to grateful mirth belongs,<br />
Let&rsquo;s celebrate our feasts; and let us see<br />
That all our jests without reflection be.<br />
Insipid poems let no man rehearse,<br />
Nor any be compelled to write a verse.<br />
All noise of vain disputes must he forborne,<br />
And let no lover in a corner mourn,<br />
To fight and brawl, like hectors, let none dare,<br />
Glasses or windows break, or hangings tear,<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er shall publish what&rsquo;s here done or said<br />
From our society must be banishèd;<br />
Let none by drinking do or suffer harm,<br />
And, while we stay, let us be always warm.<br />
</p>

<p>In one of his plays he absurdly compares the host of
the &lsquo;New Inn&rsquo; to one of those stone jugs called &lsquo;Long
Beards.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>Who&rsquo;s at the best some round grown thing&mdash;<i>a jug</i><br />
<i>Fac&rsquo;d with a beard</i>, that fills out to the guests.<br />
</p>

<p>These stone vessels may be recognised as glazed, of
a mottled brown colour, with a narrow neck and wide-spreading
belly, a rudely executed face with a long flowing
beard, and a handle behind. Mr. Chaffers, from
whom this description is taken, says that these vessels
were in general use in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries at public-houses, to serve ale to the customers.
The largest size held eight pints. Some of them bore
coats-of-arms. They were also called <i>Bellarmines</i>, after
the celebrated cardinal who so opposed the progress of
the reformers that he incurred the hatred of the Protestants,
who manifested their rancour by satire such as
this bottle, which figured a hard-featured son of Adam.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cynthia&rsquo;s Revels</i> of Ben Jonson, occurs an
allusion to that hideous custom, the practice of which
he attributes to a representative lover stabbing himself,
drinking a health, and writing languishing letters in his
blood. In the <i>Humorous Lieutenant</i> of Beaumont and
Fletcher, allusion is made to the same practice of gentlemen
cutting and stabbing themselves, and mingling their
blood with the wine in which they toasted their mistresses.
In the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> the Prince of Morocco,
with the same meaning, speaks of &lsquo;making an incision
for love.&rsquo; Jonson occupied the president&rsquo;s chair in the
Apollo room in the <i>Devil</i> Tavern (on the site of which
is Child&rsquo;s bank), surrounded by the &lsquo;eruditi, urbani,
hilares, honesti,&rsquo; of that age. A contemporary dramatist,
Shakerly Marmion, describes him thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">The boon Delphic god</span><br />
Drinks <i>sack</i>, and keeps his Bacchanalia,<br />
And has his incense and his altars smoking,<br />
And speaks in sparkling prophecies.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The tavern to which Ben gave such a lasting reputation
had for a sign the Devil, and St. Dunstan twigging
his nose with a pair of hot tongs. Over the chimney
inside were engraved in black marble his <i>leges conviviales</i>,
and over the door some verses by the same hand, which
wind up with a eulogistic encomium upon wine.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Ply it, and you all are mounted,<br />
&lsquo;Tis the true Ph&oelig;bian liquor,<br />
Cheers the brains, makes wit the quicker;<br />
Pays all debts, cures all diseases,<br />
And at once three senses pleases.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Two authors, who would well bear comparison, remain
to be mentioned&mdash;Barnabie Googe and Thomas
Tusser. The latter was a georgical poet of great popularity
in the sixteenth century. His poems were faithful
pictures of the domestic life of the English farmer of his
day. He concerns us now simply for his belief in the
strengthening virtues of the hop. Among his &lsquo;Directions
for Cultivating a Hop Garden,&rsquo; we find:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The hop for his profit I thus do exalt,<br />
It strengtheneth drink, and it favoureth malt;<br />
And being well brewed, long kept it will last,<br />
And drawing abide&mdash;if ye draw not too fast.<br />
</p>

<p>His entire poem, after considerable expansion, appeared
under the title of <i>Five Hundreth Points of Good
Husbandrie</i>.</p>

<p>Googe wrote upon the same subject.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> We can glean
from him some useful information upon the culture of
the vine in England. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We might have a reasonable good wine growing in many places
of this realme; as undoubtedly wee had immediately after the
Conquest; tyll partly by slouthfulnesse, not liking anything long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>that is painefull, partly by civil discord long-continuying, it was
left, and so with tyme lost, as appeareth by a number of places in
this realme that keepe still the name of vineyardes; and uppon
many cliffes and hilles are yet to be seene the rootes and olde
remaynes of vines. There is besides Nottingham an auncient
house, called Chilwell, in which house remayneth yet, as an
auncient monument, in a great wyndowe of glasse, the whole order
of planting, pruyning, stamping, and pressing of vines. Beside
there is yet also growing an old vine, that yields a grape sufficient
to make a right good wine, as was lately proved. There hath,
moreover, good experience of late yeears been made, by two noble
and honorable barons of this realme, the lorde Cobham and the
lorde Willyams of Tame, who had both growyng about their houses
as good wines as are in many parts of Fraunce.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="subheading">STUART PERIOD.</p>


<p>In entering upon this period it will be necessary to consider,
in the first place, what were the drinks chiefly in
use. A pamphlet, bearing the date 1612, enumerates a
number of the wines then popular:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some drinking the neat wine of Orleance, some the Gasgony,
some the Bordeaux. There wanted neither sherry sack, nor
Charneco, Malyfo, nor amber-coloured Candy, nor liquorish
Ipocras, brown beloved Bastard, fat Aligant, nor any quick-spirited
liquor.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p></div>

<p>That Spanish wines of the Sacke species were now
especial favourites, is evident from an ordinance of
James I.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas, in times past, Spanish wines, called sacke, were little
or no whit used in our court, and that in late years, though not of
ordinary allowance, it was thought convenient that such noblemen
and women and others of account, as had diet in the court, upon
their necessities by sicknesse or otherwise, might have a bowle or
glasse of sacke, and so no great quantity spent; we understanding
that within these late years it is used as common to all order,
using it rather for wantonnesse and surfeiting than for necessity, to
a great and wasteful expense.... Our pleasure is that there be
allowed to the serjeant of our seller 12 gallons of sacke a day, and
no more.</p></div>

<p>The fashion of Malmsey had passed away, and the
Hungarian red wine (Ofener) had taken its place. It
came by Breslau to Hamburg, whence it was shipped to
England. Very little Hungarian wine used to be made
with a view to exportation. Now many sorts find their
way to this country, notably the Carlowitz. The wine-jurors
of the 1862 Exhibition reported:&mdash;&lsquo;Great expectations
have been formed of the capability of Hungary as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>a wine supplying country. The produce is large, amounting
to nearly 250,000,000 gallons yearly. Many of the
wines are good, but more careful treatment is generally
required.&rsquo; At one time only imperial Tokay was known
in England as the produce of that country.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Hock was also in high repute:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
What wine is it? Hock,<br />
By the mass, brave wine.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Besides wine, beer and spirits were both adopted.
Spirits used to be called <i>strong waters</i>, and <i>comfortable
waters</i>; thus, when Sir George Summers of Lyme, in
1609, was driven before a hurricane, which led to his
discovery of the Bermudas, there appeared no hope of
saving the ship, so waterlogged was she. In this extremity,
those who had &lsquo;comfortable waters&rsquo; drank to
one another as taking their last leaves.</p>

<p>Ale and beer were both in common use. But a new
kind arose in competition. Dr. Butler, physician to
James I., and, according to Fuller, the Æsculapius of
that age, invented a kind of medicated ale, called <i>Dr.
Butler&rsquo;s Ale</i>, which used to be sold at houses that had
the &lsquo;Butler&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; for a sign.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>But to pass from the <i>quid</i> to the <i>quatenus</i>, as Bishop
Andrewes would say. Were these liquors drunk to excess?
We should suspect that such would be the case, knowing
the example of the Court, and remembering that not a
little of the literature of the time abetted free living,
whilst, at the same time, legislative restriction and ecclesiastical
monition were rife, and in certain quarters, both
clerical and lay, these excesses were vehemently anathematised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the legislative, we shall find, was active, far
more active than the executive, as appears from the
renewal of an important statute in the same reign, just
as though it had utterly ceased to be in force. The
king showed great desire to enforce several statutes, but
the difficulty lay in the fact that he was the first to infringe
them. In fact, as Green does not hesitate to
aver, the king was known to be an habitual drunkard;
ladies of rank copied the royal manners, and rolled intoxicated
in open court at the king&rsquo;s feet.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> His tutor,
Buchanan, was a great drinker; and his nurse is said to
have been a drunkard,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> which latter circumstance gave
him a predisposition to drink; the relation of cause and
effect in such cases being established. Dr. Mitchell, one
of the Lunacy Commissioners, stated in evidence before
the Select Committee on Habitual Drunkards in 1872:
&lsquo;It is quite certain that the children of habitual drunkards
are in a larger proportion idiotic than other children, and
in a larger proportion themselves habitual drunkards.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The king&rsquo;s hereditary tendency was not improved by his
connection with Denmark. In the carouses with which
that Court celebrated the royal nuptials, James increased
that proclivity for heavy drinking to which most of his
follies may be traced. He dates his letters &lsquo;From the
castle of Cronenburg, quhaire, we are drinking and driving
<i>our</i> in the auld manner.&rsquo; The same influence followed
him to his own dominions. A tavern sign, &lsquo;The
King of Denmark,&rsquo; perpetuates to this day a royal visit
which was celebrated with unparalleled orgies. It will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>be remembered that James I. married a sister of Christian
IV., king of Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In 1606 the Danish king,
Christian, paid a visit to this country. He and his
brother-in-law, James, were invited to a festival at Theobalds,
the seat of the Prime Minister Cecil, Earl of
Salisbury. The revellings there were disgraced by scenes
of intemperance which have acquired historical notoriety.
The queen was by necessity absent at the time when
the kings were abandoning themselves to unrestrained
excess. Mr. Samuelson, in his <i>History of Drink</i>, has
fallen into the error of certain writers of the last century
who have accused Queen Anne of the derelictions from
propriety committed on this occasion by a certain <i>queen</i>,
who, having taken too much, reeled against the steps of
King Christian&rsquo;s throne. But, as is pointed out by
Strickland, this <i>queen</i> was only the Queen of Sheba,
personated by a female servant of the Earl of Salisbury,
and not the Queen of Great Britain, as any one may
ascertain who reads Sir John Harrington&rsquo;s letter, the
sole document on which is founded the mistaken accusation
of intemperance against the queen of James I. The
story has been often told in whole or part, but it may be
well to produce the original.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

precious gifts to both their majesties, but forgetting the steppes
arising to the canopy, overset her caskets in his Danish Majesty&rsquo;s
lap, and fell at his feet, though I rather think it was on his face.
Much was the hurry and confusion&mdash;cloths and napkins were at
hand to make all clean. His Majesty then got up, and would dance
with the Queen of Sheba, but he fell down and humbled himself
before her and was carried to his inner chamber. The entertainment
and show went forward, and most of the presenters went
backward or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers.</p></div>

<p>Much more is told, but one sentence is pregnant:
&lsquo;The gunpowder fright is out of all our heads, and we
are going on hereabouts, as if the devil were contriving
every man should blow up himself by wild riot, excess,
and devastation of wine and intemperance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The queen was not present; indeed, she was not
even a guest of the earl at this time, but was confined to
her chamber sick and sad at Greenwich Palace. At a
banquet on the Thames, however, given soon after by
her royal brother, the queen was present. They pledged
each other to continued friendship. To each pledge,
drum, trumpet, and cannon were responsive. Shakespeare
describes a similar scene:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br />
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell.<br />
</p>

<p>Such pledges of friendship seem almost typical of the
happy event of 1863, to which Jean Ingelow so exquisitely
alludes in her &lsquo;Wedding song.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Come up the broad river, the Thames, my Dane,<br />
My Dane, with the beautiful eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
And they said, &lsquo;He is young, the lad we love,<br />
The heir of the Isles is young;<br />
How we deem of his mother, and one gone above,<br />
Can neither be said nor sung.<br />
He brings us a pledge&mdash;he will do his part<br />
With the best of his race and name;&rsquo;<br />
And I will, for I look to live, sweetheart,<br />
As may suit with Thy mother&rsquo;s fame.<br />
</p>

<p>But, taking leave of the court, let us proceed to discover
the manners of the people, from contemporary
authors and dramatists. Much is to be gleaned from
the voluminous writings of Thomas Decker, whose pamphlets
and plays, the <i>Quarterly Review</i> once said, would
furnish a more complete view of the habits and customs
of his contemporaries in vulgar and middle life than
could easily be collected from all the grave annals of the
times. His <i>Seven Deadly Sins of London</i>, published in
1606, is a mighty invective against the iniquity of the
day. It has been well remarked in the introduction to
Arber&rsquo;s reprint of the work, how much the mind of the
writer was imbued with the style of the old Hebrew prophets,
and how sure he was that that style would find a
response in the hearts of his readers. For instance,
how like the &lsquo;burden of the Word of the Lord&rsquo; is his
apostrophe to London&mdash;&lsquo;<i>O London</i>, thou art great in
glory, and envied for thy greatness. Thou art the goodliest
of thy neighbours, but the proudest, the wealthiest,
the most wanton.... Thou sit&rsquo;st in thy gates heated
with wines.&rsquo; In his account of the third deadly sin, he
speaks of wines, Spanish and French, meeting in the
cellar, conspiring together to lay the <i>Englishman</i> under
the board. Perhaps his finest effort of prosopopæia is
his impersonation of sloth, whom he represents as giving
licences to all the vintners to &lsquo;keepe open house, and to
emptye their hogsheades to all commers, who did so, dyeing
their grates into a drunkard&rsquo;s blush (to make them
knowe from gates of a prison) lest customers should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
reele away from them, and hanging out new bushes,
that if men at their going out could not see the signe,
yet they might not lose themselves in the bush....
And as <i>drunkennesse</i> when it least can stand, does best
hold up ale-houses, so <i>sloth</i> is a founder of the alms-houses,
... and is a good benefactor to these last.&rsquo;
To call attention to this author&rsquo;s notices of such <i>rules
of drunkenness</i> as Vpsy-Freeze, Crambo, Parmizant, &amp;c.,
would be beside the present object; but the book will
amply repay study, and serve as a commentary on
Defoe&rsquo;s <i>Plague of London</i>. Several other of his works
bear upon the present theme, <i>e.g.</i> <i>The Batchelor&rsquo;s Banquet</i>,
<i>Lanthorne and Candle Light</i>, and <i>English Villanies
prest to Death</i>.</p>

<p>A writer quite as voluminous, and equally with
Decker a scourge of iniquity, was George Wyther (persistently
called by so many&mdash;Hazlitt and Brand among
the number&mdash;Wythers). In 1613 he brought out his
satirical essays, <i>Abuses Stript and Whipt</i>, the truth and
beauty of which, to his honour be it said, touched the
heart of Charles Lamb, who observes:<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The game run down is coarse general vice, or folly as it appears
in classes. A liar, a drunkard, a coxcomb, is <i>stript and whipt</i>....
To a well-natured mind, there is a charm of moral sensibility running
through them. Wither seems everywhere bursting with a love of
goodness, and a hatred of all low and base actions. At this day it
is hard to discover what parts in the poem <i>Abuses Stript</i> could have
occasioned the imprisonment of the author. Was vice in high
places more suspicious than now?</p></div>

<p>Reference has already been made to the allusion in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>this work of Wither to the custom of <i>Hock-tide</i>. He
ridicules the notion of such an observance and that of
<i>ales</i> subserving the devotion of youth, and indignantly
asks,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
What will they do, I say, that think to please<br />
Their mighty God with such fond things as these?<br />
Sure, very ill.<br />
</p>

<p>In this same work occurs an allusion to the then common
practice of inserting <i>toast</i> into ale with nutmeg and
sugar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Will he will drinke, yet but a draught at most,<br />
That must be spiced with a <i>nut-browne tost</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The origin of the word <i>toast</i> is much disputed, as is
elsewhere observed, and no better account of it is forthcoming
than that the word was taken from the toast
which was put into the tankard, and which still floats in
the loving cup. Hence the person named was the toast
or savour of the wine, that which gives the draught
piquancy.</p>

<p>Many other of the drinking customs of the day are
criticised, but not all with censure. The ode to Christmas,
for instance, contrasts strongly with his later
puritanical sentiments. Neither sectarian gloom nor
civil struggles had yet enveloped the author when he
wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Drown sorrow in a cup of wine,<br />
And let us all be merry.<br />
Hark how the roofs with laughter sound!<br />
Anon they&rsquo;ll think the house goes round,<br />
For they the cellars&rsquo; depth have found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they will be merry,</span><br />
</p>

<p>which introduces a stanza upon <i>wassailing</i>. A change
must have come over his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>dream before he wrote his
second ode on the same subject, which alone would
entitle him to the encomiums of Hazlitt or any other
critic.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Far more unqualified denunciation of seventeenth
century excess is to be found in a volume by Thomas
Young (1617), entitled <i>England&rsquo;s Bane, or the Description
of Drunkennesse</i>. He says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are in London drinking schooles: so that drunkennesse is
professed with us as a liberall arte and science.... I have seene
a company amongst the very woods and forests drinking for a
<i>muggle</i>. Sixe determined to trie their strengths who could drinke
most glasses for the muggle. The first drinkes a glasse of a pint,
the second two, the next three, and so every one multiplieth till the
last taketh sixe. Then the first beginneth againe and taketh seven,
and in this manner they drinke thrice a peece round, every man
taking a glasse more than his fellow, so that he that dranke least,
which was the first, drank one and twenty pints, and the sixth man
thirty-six.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></div>

<p>Scarcely less absurd than these laws of drunkenness,
are the laws of health-drinking as described by Barnaby
Rich in his work published 1619, the title of which
is an excellent preface to the subject-matter, &lsquo;<i>The Irish
Hubbub, or the English Hue and Crie</i>; briefly pursuing
the base conditions and most notorious offences of this
vile, vaine, and wicked age. No less smarting than
tickling,&rsquo; &amp;c. The following is his description of toasting
laws:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He that beginneth the health hath his prescribed orders; first
uncovering his head, hee takes a full cup in his hand, and settling
his countenance with a grave aspect, hee craves for audience;
silence being once obtained, hee begins to breath out the name
peradventure of some honourable personage that is worthy of a
better regard than to have his name polluted amongst a company
of drunkards; but his healthe is drunke to, and hee that pledgeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>must likewise off with his cap, kisse his fingers, and bowing himselfe
in signe of a reverent acceptance. When the leader sees
his follower thus prepared, he soups up his broath, turnes the
bottom of the cup upward, and in ostentation of his dexteritie,
gives the cup a phillip, to make it cry <i>twango</i>. And thus the first
scene is acted. The cup being newly replenished, to the breadthe
of an haire, he that is the pledger must now beginne his part,
and thus it goes round throughout the whole company, provided
alwaies by a cannon set downe by the founder, there must be three
at the least still uncovered, till the health hath had the full passage,
which is no sooner ended, but another begins againe, and he drinks
a health, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>It appears from another author, that this method
was accounted a procedure <i>in order</i>, for he adds, &lsquo;It is
drunke <i>without order</i> when the course or method of order
is not observed, and that the cup passeth on to whomsoever
we shall appoint.&rsquo; Drink is the burden of the
songs of this hilarious writer, who is usually, known by
the sobriquet of Drunken Barnaby (or Barnabea) from
the titles he himself employed. It is curiously illustrative
of the hold that convivial phrases had upon the
popular mind that we find a pious divine solemnly quoting
the words of a suffering Christian, one Lawrence
Saunders, to this effect,&mdash;&lsquo;My Saviour began to mee in a
bitter cup, and shall not I <i>pledge</i> Him?&rsquo; [<i>i.e.</i> drink the
same cup of sorrow]. The divine just alluded to, Dr.
Samuel Ward, of Ipswich, in his sermon (1685) entitled
&lsquo;Woe to Drunkards,&rsquo; anathematises <i>toasting</i>: &lsquo;Abandon
that foolish and vicious custome, as Ambrose and
Basil call it, of drinking healths, and making that a
sacrifice to God for the health of others, which is rather
a sacrifice to the devil, and a bane of their owne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But this kind of appeal was by no means confined to
the pulpit. Robert Burton, the famous author of the
<i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> (1621), who cannot be accused of
being strait-laced (at any rate, Anthony Wood sp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>eaks
of his company as very merry, facete, and juvenile), in
his pungent chapter on Dyet as a cause of melancholy,
exclaims,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What immoderate drinking in every place! How they flock to
the tavern! as if they were born to no other end but to eat and
drink, as so many casks to hold wine; yea, worse than a cask, that
marrs wine, and itself is not marred by it.... &lsquo;Tis now come to
that pass, that he is no gentleman, a very milk-sop, that will not
drink, fit for no company.... No disparagement now to stagger
in the streets, reel, rave, &amp;c., but much to his renown.... &lsquo;Tis
the <i>summum bonum</i> of our tradesmen, their felicity, life, and soul,
to be merry together in an ale-house or tavern, as our modern Muscovites
do in their mede-inns, and Turks in their coffee-houses.
They will labour hard all day long, to be drunk at night, and spend
<i>totius anni labores</i> in a tippling feast.... How they love a man
that will be drunk, crown him, and honour him for it, hate him that
will not pledge him, stab him, kill him: a most intolerable offence,
and not to be forgiven.</p></div>

<p>Again, in his chapter on &lsquo;Mirth and Merry Company,&rsquo;
he warns,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But see the mischief; many men, knowing that merry company
is the only medicine against melancholy, will therefore neglect
their business, and spend all their days among good fellows in a
tavern, and know not otherwise how to bestow their time but in
drinking; malt-worms, men-fishes, or water-snakes, like so many
frogs in a puddle.... Flourishing wits and men of good parts,
good fashion, and good worth, basely prostitute themselves to every
rogue&rsquo;s company to take tobacco and drink.... They drown their
wits, seeth their brains in ale, consume their fortunes, lose their
time, weaken their temperatures, contract filthy diseases, rheumes,
dropsies, calentures, tremor, get swoln juglars, pimpled red faces,
sore eyes, &amp;c.; heat their livers, alter their complexions, spoil their
stomachs, overthrow their bodies (for drink drowns more than the
sea and all the rivers that fall into it), mere funges and casks&mdash;confound
their souls, suppress reason, go from Scylla to Charybdis.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>If such were the avowed expressions of Burton, we
shall not wonder to find such men as George Herbert
and Bishop Hall vehement in denunciation of the same
bane.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Because luxury is a very visible sin, the parson is very careful
to avoid all the kinds thereof, <i>but especially that of drinking,
because it is the most popular vice</i>; into which if he come, he
prostitutes himself both to shame, and sin, and by having fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness, he disableth himself of
authority to reprove them: for sins make all equal whom they find
together; and then they are worst, who ought to be best. Neither
is it for the servant of Christ to haunt inns, or taverns, or ale-houses,
to the dishonour of his person and office.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></div>

<p>This passage is quoted to call attention to the words
italicised (not by Herbert), <i>&lsquo;because it is the most popular
vice</i>;&rsquo; an independent confirmation of the excessive
drinking in the reign of James I.</p>

<p>Again, in <i>The Parson in Journey</i>, chapter xvii.,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When he comes to any house, where his kindred or other
relations give him any authority over the family, if he be to stay
for a time, he considers diligently the state thereof to God-ward,
and that in two points: First, what disorders there are either in
apparel, or diet, <i>or too open a buttery</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The meaning of the words italicised is mistaken by
the occasional annotator to Bohn&rsquo;s edition, who explains
it, &lsquo;A repository or store-room for certain provisions.&rsquo;
But in Elizabethan and Jacobean times, <i>buttery</i> always
meant the place where the beer (or wine) was kept.
Evidence is forthcoming from our dramatists of those
periods. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Maria, in <i>Twelfth Night</i> (act i., scene 3), says to
the unfortunate butt Sir Andrew Ague-cheek, &lsquo;I pray
you bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) Middleton, in <i>A Trick to Catch the Old One</i> (Ed.
Dyce, vol. ii.), has a clear proof, in the words, &lsquo;Go, and
wash your lungs i&rsquo; th&rsquo; buttery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>From Herbert&rsquo;s <i>Jacula Prudentum</i> may be extracted&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A drunkard&rsquo;s purse is a bottle.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Choose not a house near an inn.</span><br />

A morning sun, and a wine-bred child, and a<br />

<p>Once more, from the <i>Church Porch</i>,&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Bishop Hall was unsparing in his lashes of the vices
of his time, and amongst these of intemperance. We
hear him in verse and prose, in critique and sermon.
Thus, in his <i>Satire on the Stage</i>,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Soon as the sun sends out his piercing beams<br />
Exhale out filthy smoke and stinking streams,<br />
So doth the base and the fore-barren brain,<br />
Soon as the raging wine begins to reign.<br />
</p>

<p>In his <i>Contemplation</i> on Lot he remarks, &lsquo;Drunkenness
is the way to all bestial affections and acts. Wine
knows no difference either of persons or sins.&rsquo; In his
sermon preached at Paul&rsquo;s Cross, on Good Friday, 1609,
we find &lsquo;Every of our sins is a thorn, and nail, and
spear to Him; while thou pourest down thy drunken
carouses, thou givest thy Saviour a portion of gall.&rsquo;
Why are not the preachers of to-day equally outspoken?
One of his apophthegms can scarcely be forgotten:<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
&lsquo;When drinke is in, wit is out; but if wit were not out,
drinke would not be in;&rsquo; and, lastly,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Wine is a mocker. When it goes plausibly in, no man can
know how it will rage and tyrannise. He that receives that traitor
within his gates shall too late complain of surprisal. It insinuates
sweetly, but in the end it bites like a serpent and hurts like a
cockatrice. Even good Uriah is made drunk. The holiest may be
overtaken.</p></div>

<p>But it is time to pass from precept to <i>law</i>.</p>

<p>In 1603 the power of licensing inns and ale-houses
was granted by letters patent to certain persons, in which
it was enacted that no victualler could sell less than one
full quart of the best ale for one penny, and two quarts
of the smaller sort for the same. The preamble of the
statute of 1604 is most valuable for the information it
affords as to what the ancient Parliaments considered to
be the legitimate use of a tavern.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas the ancient, true, and principal use of wine, ale-houses,
and victualling-houses was for the receipt, relief, and lodging of
wayfaring people travelling from place to place, and for the supply
of the wants of such people as are not able by greater quantities to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>make their provision of victuals; and not meant for entertainment
and harbouring of lewd and idle people to spend and consume
their money and time in lewd and drunken manner: it is enacted
that only travellers, and travellers&rsquo; friends, and labourers for one
hour at dinner-time or lodgers can receive entertainment under
penalty.</p></div>

<p>The statute of 4th James imposes <i>punishment for
drunkenness</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas the loathsome and odious sin of drunkenness is of late
grown into common use, being the root and foundation of many
other enormous sins, as bloodshed, stabbing, murder, swearing,
fornication, adultery, and such like, to the great dishonour of God
and of our nation, the overthrow of many good arts and manual
trades, the disabling of divers workmen, and the general impoverishing
of many good subjects, abusively wasting the good creatures of
God.</p></div>

<p>Therefore a fine of five shillings was imposed for
intoxication, or confinement in the stocks for six hours,
and for the first offence of remaining drinking in a person&rsquo;s
own neighbourhood, a fine of three shillings and
fourpence, or the stocks, the penalty being increased for
further offence. The fine, it must be remembered, was
worth several times the same amount imposed now for
intoxication, and the high road to it, tippling, is now
passed over. The time prescribed in the stocks was fixed
at six hours, because by that time the statute presumed
the offender would have regained his senses, and not be
liable to do mischief to his neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Little success can as yet have attended legislation,
for in 1609, the statute, admitting that &lsquo;notwithstanding
all former laws and provisions already made, the
inordinate and extreme vice of excessive drinking and
drunkenness doth more and more abound,&rsquo; enacts that
offenders convicted against the two last Acts shall be
deprived of their licence. Again has this statute to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>renewed in 1623, as though the executive had slept.
Among the grievances that the Parliament of 1621
examined was one that patents had been granted to Sir
Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michel, for licensing
inns and ale-houses; that great sums of money had
been exacted under pretext of these licences; and that
such innkeepers as presumed to continue their business
without satisfying the rapacity of the patentees, had been
severely punished by fine, imprisonment, and vexatious
prosecutions. The patentees were denounced as criminals.
They fled for refuge. Sentence was passed upon them,
which, in the case of Mompesson, was commuted. Many
useful hints might be learnt from purely local legislation
from time to time. Indeed, a most useful code might be
formed from a digest of borough enactments. Let one
illustration suffice. We find a local law at Lyme, about
this time, to the effect that no retailer of beer was to
sell to any craftsman or servant of the town, unless he
was in company with a stranger. In 1612 it was there
ordered that no one should tipple any one day above one
hour in any house. It merely remains to be noticed
that in Cott. MSS. Titus B. III. Codex chartaceus, in
folio, Constans fol. 281, may be found&mdash;</p>

<p>The reign of Charles I. very nearly covers the
second quarter of the seventeenth century. If we had
to select a single author as our guide to the social habits
of the time, we should probably at once fix upon Thomas
Heywood, the busiest of dramatic writers, &lsquo;a sort of
prose Shakespeare,&rsquo; as Charles Lamb makes bold to say.
Of his numerous works, one is a direct exposure of
the then drinking customs.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The immense variety of
drinking-cups, as well as the intrinsic value of many of
them, speaks volumes. He describes them as &lsquo;some of
elme, some of box, some of maple, some of holly, &amp;c.,
mazers, broad-mouth&rsquo;d dishes, moggins, whiskins, piggins,
cruizes, ale-bowles, wassell-bowles, court-dishes,
tankards, kannes, from a bottle to a pint, from a pint to
a gill. Other bottles we have of leather, but they are
most used amongst the shepheards and harvest-people
of the countrey; small jacks wee have in many ale-houses,
of the citie and suburbs, tip&rsquo;t with silver, besides the
great black jacks and bombards at the court, which
when the Frenchmen first saw, they reported at their
returne into their countrey, that the Englishmen used to
drinke out of their bootes: we have besides, cups made
of horns of beasts, of cocker-nuts, of goords, of the eggs
of estriches, others made of the shells of divers fishes
brought from the Indies and other places, and shining
like mother of pearl. Come to plate, every taverne
can afford you flat bowls, prounet cups, beare bowles,
beakers; and private householders in the citie, when
they make a feast to entertain their friends, can furnish
their cupboards with flagons, tankards, beere-cups, wine-bowls,
some white, some percell gilt, some gilt all over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>some with covers, some without, of sundry shapes and
qualities.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the same books occurs the following curious
satire:&mdash;&lsquo;There is now profest an eighth liberal art or
science, called <i>Ars Bibendi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Art of Drinking.
The students or professors thereof call a greene garland,
or painted hoope hang&rsquo;d out, a <i>colledge</i>, a sign where
there is lodging, man&rsquo;s-meate, and horse-meate, an <i>inne
of court</i>, an <i>hall</i> or an <i>hostle</i>, where nothing is sold but
ale and tobacco, a <i>grammar schoole</i>; a red or a blue
lattice, that they terme <i>a free schoole</i> for all comers....
The bookes which they studdy, and whose leaves they so
often turne over are for the most part three of the old
translation and three of the new. Those of the old
translation&mdash;1, The Tankard; 2, The Black Jacke; 3, The
Quart-Pot, Rib&rsquo;d, or Thorondell. Those of the new be
these: 1, The Jugge; 2, The Beaker; 3, The Double or
Single Can, or Black Pot.&rsquo; The same author gives a
list of slang phrases then in use, signifying the being
intoxicated. &lsquo;He is foxt, hee is flawed, he is flustered,
hee is suttle, cupshot, he hath seene the French king,
he hath swallowed an havie or a taverne-token, hee hath
whipt the cat, he hath been at the scriveners, and
learn&rsquo;d to make indentures, hee hath bit his grannam,
or is bit by a barne-weesell,&rsquo; &amp;c. In another of his
productions, <i>Shipwreck by Drink</i>, he describes a drunken
scene which took place in a house that he was passing
in which a feast was being held:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In the height of their carousing, all their brains<br />
Warmed with the heat of wine.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>And a marvellous piece of description it is. The
guests imagine themselves to be rocked in a vessel
during storm, climb bedposts as though they were
masts, turn out the furniture as if casting ship-lading
overboard; another bestrides his fellow to escape, Arion-like,
on the dolphin&rsquo;s back. The staff of the constable
who enters is considered to be Neptune&rsquo;s trident, and so
forth.</p>

<p>But enough of this author. The habits of his time
had evidently impressed him, and he constantly revives
his impression. But it was no self-formed phantom.
Abundance of corroboration is forthcoming. A political
economist of the same date (1627) remarks, &lsquo;This
most monstrous vice is thus defined:&mdash;&ldquo;Drunkenness is
the privation of orderly motion and understanding.&rdquo; ...
But I need not stand much about the definition of
drunkenness, for, with grief I speak it, the taverns, ale-houses,
and the very streets are so full of drunkards in
all parts of this kingdom, that by the sight of them it
is better known what this detestable and odious vice is
than by any definition whatsoever.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Regarding it then as established, that the intemperance
of the times of Elizabeth and James I. was still
perpetuated, it is natural to inquire to what it is to be
attributed.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The attractiveness of the drinks themselves</i>, a constant
factor in all periods.</p>

<p>Of wines, Canary and sack were in most demand,
though these were constantly terms indifferently used;
thus,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Some sack, boy.<br />
Good sherry-sack, sir?<br />
I meant Canary, sir; what, hast no brains?<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The following is the explanation of the confusion in
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Your best sacks are of Xeres in Spain; your smaller, of Gallicia
and Portugall; your strong sacks are of the islands of the Canaries
and of Malligo, and your Muskadine and Malmseys are of many
parts, of Italy, Greece, and some special islands;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p></div>

<p>and renders intelligible the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Two kinsmen near allied to sherry sack,<br />
Sweet Malligo and delicate Canary.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a><br />
</p>

<p>It is extolled in Beaumont and Fletcher:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Give me a cup of sack<br />
An ocean of sweet sack.<br />
</p>

<p>Canary was in great esteem. John Howell praises it
as &lsquo;accounted the richest, the most firm, the best bodied,
and lastingest wine: while French wine pickles meat in
the stomach, this is the wine that digests, and doth not only
breed good bloud, but it nutrifieth also, being a glutinous
substantial liquor. Of this wine, if of any other,
may be verified that merry induction, that good wine
makes good blood, good blood causeth good humours,
good humours causeth good thoughts, good thoughts
bring forth good works, good works carry a man to
heaven; ergo good wine carrieth a man to heaven. If
this be true, surely more English go to heaven this way
than any other, for I think there is more Canary brought
to England than to all the world besides.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>But probably no kind of drink came amiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>(2) The prevailing habit of <i>toasting</i> may be set down
as a second cause, and a powerful factor it must have
been in national corruption, if the case is not overstated
by William Prynne,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> who wrote his startling book to
prove &lsquo;the Drinking and Pledging of Healthes to be
Sinfull and utterly Unlawful unto Christians.&rsquo; In his
Epistle Dedicatorie to King Charles I. he urges that
his Majesty&rsquo;s <i>health</i> is an occasion, apologie, pretence,
and justification of excesse.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Alas! how many thousand persons have been drawne on to
drunkennesse, drinking their wit out of their heads, their health
out of their bodies, and God out of their soules, whiles they have
beene too busy and officious in carrying healthes unto your sacred
Majestie.</p></div>

<p>Following upon this is an appeal &lsquo;To the Christian
Reader,&rsquo; in which he offers six reasons &lsquo;why men are
so much infatuated with the odious sinne of drunkennesse.
(<i>a</i>) The inbred corruption and practice of humane
nature. (<i>b</i>) The power of the Prince of the ayre, who
hath lately gotten such high predominance in the souls
of vitious men, that they doe not only glory in their
drunkennesse, proclaiming it unto the world, but set
themselves against the God of Heaven, violating the very
lawes of nature and the very rules of reason. (<i>c</i>) The
third reason is, the popular titles given to abettors
of intemperance, <i>e.g.</i>, good fellow, sociable, joviall boon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>companion, good natured, &amp;c.; whilst mottoes of ignominy
are applied to the temperate, <i>e.g.</i>, Puritanisme,
discourtesie, coynesse, singularitie, stoicisme, &amp;c.
(<i>d</i>) The fourth reason is the negligence and coldnesse
of justices, magistrates, &amp;c., in the faithful execution
of those pious statutes enacted by the State against
this sinne. &ldquo;If justices were as diligent to suppresse
drunkennesse and <i>ale-houses</i> as they are industrious
to patronise them, the wings of drunkenness would
soon be clipt, whereas now they spread and grow,
because the sword of execution clipse them not.&rdquo;
(<i>e</i>) The fifth cause why this gangrene doth so dilate is
the ill example of gentlemen, great men, magistrates, and
ministers, who either approve excesse, or tolerate it in
their misgoverned families, &ldquo;which are oftentimes made
the very theatres of Bacchus, and the seminaries, sinkes,
and puddles of ryot and intemperance, under pretence of
hospitality.&rdquo; (<i>f</i>) The sixth cause assigned is, &ldquo;Those
common ceremonies, wiles, and stratagems which the
deuill and his drunken rowt have invented, of purpose to
alure, force, and draw men on to excesse of wine.&rdquo; ...
There is no such common bayte to entice men to intemperance
as this idle, heathenish, and hellish ceremonie
of <i>beginning</i>, <i>seconding</i>, and <i>pledging</i> healthes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Prynne then proceeds in the book proper to give
fifteen arguments against health-drinking, drawn out
in syllogistic form. Perhaps the most useful part of
the book is the array of quotations from &lsquo;the Fathers&rsquo;
against occasions of intemperance; SS. Augustine, Basil,
and Ambrose being most frequently quoted. He vindicates
Luther from a charge laid against him by the
Papists, which cannot be omitted. They put it about
&lsquo;that Luther once made a great feast at his hou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>se, to
which he invited the chiefest Professours of the Universitie,
and among the rest one Islebius. Dinner being
ended, and all of them somewhat merry, Luther, after
the Germane custome, commanded a great glasse divided
with three kindes of circles to be brought unto him; and
out of it he drunke an health in order to all his guesse.
When all of them had drunke, the health came at last
to Islebius. Luther then, in the presence of all the rest,
takes this glasse, being filled up, into his hand, and,
shewing it to Islebius, saith: &ldquo;Islebius, I drinke this
glasse full of wine unto thee, which containes the tenne
commandements to the first circle; the Apostles&rsquo; Creed
to the second, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer to the third, and the
Catechisme to the bottom.&rdquo; When he had spoken, he
drinkes off the whole glasse at a draught; which being
replenished with wine, he delivers it to Islebius, that he
might pledge him all at a breath, who takes the glasse
and drunke it off onely to the first circle, which did containe
the Decalogue&mdash;it being impossible for him to drink
any deeper&mdash;and then sets downe the glasse on the table,
which hee could not behold againe without horrour: then
said Luther, &ldquo;I knew full well before, that Islebius could
drinke the Decalogue, but not the Creed, the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, and the Catechisme.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He further cites some canons from ancient Councils;
the most important being Canon xv. of the Council of
Lateran, 1215:&mdash;&lsquo;Let all clergymen diligently abstain
from surfeitings and drunkenness. For which let them
moderate wine from themselves, and themselves from
wine. Neither let any one be urged to drink, since
drunkenness doth banish wit and provoke lust. For
which purpose we decree that that abuse shall be utterly
abolished, whereby, in divers quarters, drinkers bi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>nd one
another to drink healths or equal cups, and he is most
applauded who quaffs off most carouzes. If any shall
offend henceforth in this, let him be suspended from his
benefice and office.&rsquo; Again, in the Provincial Council of
Colin, 1536, is the order&mdash;&lsquo;All parish priests or ministers
are chiefly prohibited, not only surfeiting, riot,
drunkenness, and luxurious feasts, but likewise the
drinking of healths, which they are commanded to
banish from their houses by a General Council.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thus much for the habit of toasting; but&mdash;</p>

<p>(3) We may assign as the third reason for the prevalent
excess&mdash;<i>Convivial Literature</i>. The name that first
suggests itself is that of Herrick. It is not only in poems
avowedly of this description, such as &lsquo;The Wassail&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Wassail Bowl&rsquo; but it is a vein running through
the entire seam of his songs. With him, at Christmas-time,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">My good dame, she</span><br />
Bids ye all be free,<br />
And drink to your heart&rsquo;s desiring.<br />
</p>

<p>In his <i>New Year&rsquo;s Gift</i>, he bids Sir Simeon Steward&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Remember us in cups full crowned,<br />
And let our city health go round.<br />
</p>

<p>Is he singing of Twelfth Night? No sooner is the
question of king and queen settled than their health
must be drunk:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And let not a man be seen here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who unurged will not drink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the base from the brink,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>A health to the king and queen here.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Next crown the bowl full</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gentle lamb&rsquo;s wool;</span><br />
Add sugar, nutmeg, and ginger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With store of ale too;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus ye must do</span><br />
To make the wassail a swinger.<br />
</p>

<p>Of course, &lsquo;True Hospitality&rsquo; would be impossible
without the favourite ingredient:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But as thy meat, so thy immortal wine<br />
Makes the smirk face of each to shine,<br />
And spring fresh rosebuds, while the salt, the wit,<br />
Flows from the wine, and graces it.<br />
</p>

<p>The pretty superstition that wassailing the trees will
make them bear, is included among the Christmas Eve
ceremonies in his <i>Hesperides</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Wassaile the trees, that they may beare<br />
You many a plum and many a peare;<br />
For more or lesse fruits they will bring,<br />
As you do give them wassailing.<br />
</p>

<p>The day of this ceremony varies in different localities.
In Devonshire the eve of the Epiphany is chosen; there
the farmer and his men proceed to the orchard with a
huge jug of cider, and forming a circle round a well-bearing
tree, drink the toast,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here&rsquo;s to thee, old apple tree,</span><br />
Whence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst blow!<br />
And whence thou mayst bear apples enow!<br />
Hats full! caps full!<br />
Bushel, bushel, sacks full,<br />
And my pockets full too; huzza!<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Total sustenance (not <i>abstinence</i>) was part of his
religion. In his exquisite little poem entitled &lsquo;A
Thanksgiving for his House&rsquo;&mdash;only to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> approached (of
its kind) by Bishop Wordsworth&rsquo;s hymn, &lsquo;Who givest
all&rsquo;&mdash;he thanks God, amongst other mercies, for the
<i>wassail bowl</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Lord, I confess too, when I dine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pulse is Thine,</span><br />
And all those other bits that be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There placed by Thee.</span><br />
The worts, the purslain, and the mess<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of water-cress,</span><br />
Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And my content</span><br />
Makes those, and my beloved beet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To be more sweet.</span><br />
&lsquo;Tis Thou that crown&rsquo;st my glittering hearth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With guiltless mirth;</span><br />
And giv&rsquo;st me wassail bowls to drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Spiced to the brink.</span><br />
</p>

<p>With Herrick must be coupled in this connection
the name of Cowley, of whom Dr. Johnson said, that &lsquo;if
he was formed by nature for one kind of writing more
than for another, his power seems to have been greatest
in the familiar and the festive.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> He was perfectly at
home with Anacreontics. That on &lsquo;Drinking&rsquo; will be
remembered:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Nothing in nature&rsquo;s sober found,<br />
But an eternal health goes round.<br />
Fill up the bowl then, fill it high.<br />
Fill all the glasses there, for why<br />
Should every creature drink but I?<br />
Why, men of morals, tell me why?<br />
</p>

<p>As will also &lsquo;The Epicure&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;<i>bibamus, moriendum
est</i>&rsquo; of Seneca:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Fill the bowl with spicy wine,<br />
Around our temples roses twine,<br />
And let us cheerfully awhile<br />
Like the wine and roses smile.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
To-day is ours; what do we fear?<br />
To-day is ours, we have it here.<br />
Let&rsquo;s banish business, banish sorrow;<br />
To the gods belong to-morrow.<br />
</p>

<p>Cowley&rsquo;s death was accelerated by intemperance if
we can rely upon the authority of Pope. The event
occurred while Dean Sprat was his guest. They had
visited in company a neighbour of Cowley&rsquo;s, who too
amply refreshed them. &lsquo;They did not set out for their
walk home till it was too late, and had drunk so deep
that they lay out in the fields all night. This gave
Cowley the fever that carried him off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To the same convivial school belongs Sir Richard
Fanshawe, to whom the distress of the monarch provided
occasion for a toast:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Come, pass about the bowl to me;<br />
A health to our distressed king!<br />
Though we&rsquo;re in hold, let cups go free,<br />
Birds in a cage do freely sing.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><br />
</p>

<p>And Alexander Brome, whose <i>Mad Lover</i> exemplifies
the tyranny of excessive drinking:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I have been in love and in debt and in drink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This many and many a year;</span><br />
And those three are plagues enough, one would think,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For one poor mortal to bear.</span><br />
&lsquo;Twas drink made me fall into love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love made me run into debt;</span><br />
And though I have struggled and struggled and strove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I cannot get out of them yet.</span><br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s nothing but money can cure me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rid me of all my pain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&lsquo;Twill pay all my debts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And remove all my lets,</span><br />
And my mistress that cannot endure me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will love me, and love me again;</span><br />
Then I&rsquo;ll fall to loving and drinking amain.<br />
</p>

<p>(4) A fourth cause of the intemperance of the time
was the profusion of <i>taverns</i>. Decker writes that &lsquo;a
whole street is in some places but a continuous ale-house,
not a shop to be seen between red lattice and red
lattice.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The Lord-keeper Coventry thus speaks of them:&mdash;&lsquo;I
account ale-houses and tippling-houses the greatest pests
in the kingdom. I give it you in charge to take a course
that none be permitted unless they be licensed; and for
the licensed ale-houses, let them be but few and in fit
places; if they be in private corners and ill places, they
become the den of thieves&mdash;they are the public stages of
drunkenness and disorder. Let care be taken in the
choice of ale-house keepers, that it be not appointed to
be the livelihood of a large family. In many places they
swarm by default of the justices of the peace.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It may
be remarked that by this time inns had become representative;
that is, for the most part each inn attracted
a particular species of customer. This did not escape
the notice of that keen observer Heywood:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">

</p>

<p>Bishop Earle, whose <i>Microcosmography</i> is accounted
a faithful delineation of characters as they existed in
the seventeenth century, has bequeathed the following
account of a tavern of his date:&mdash;&lsquo;A tavern is a degree,
or (if you will) a pair of stairs above an ale-house, where
men are drunk with more credit and apology. If the
vintner&rsquo;s nose be at the door, it is a sign sufficient, but
the absence of this is supplied by the ivy-bush. It is a
broacher of more news than hogsheads, and more jests
than news, which are sucked up here by some spongy
brain, and from thence squeezed into a comedy. Men
come here to make merry, but indeed make a noise, and
this music above is answered with a clinking below.
The drawers are the civillest people in it, men of good
bringing up, and howsoever we esteem them, none can
boast more justly of their high calling. &lsquo;Tis the best
theatre of natures, where they are truly acted, not played,
and the business as in the rest of the world, up and down;
to wit, from the bottom of the cellar to the great chamber.
A melancholy man would find here matter to work upon,
to see heads, as brittle as glasses, and often broken.
Men come hither to quarrel, and come here to be made
friends. It is the common consumption of the afternoon,
and the murderer or the maker away of a rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
day. It is the torrid zone that scorches the face, and
tobacco the gunpowder that blows it up. Much harm
would be done if the charitable vintner had not water
ready for the flames. A house of sin you may call it,
but not a house of darkness, for the candles are never
out; and it is like those countries far in the north,
where it is as clear at midnight as at midday. After
a long sitting it becomes like a street in a dashing
shower, where the spouts are flushing above, and the
conduits running below. To give you the total reckoning
of it, it is the busy man&rsquo;s recreation, the idle man&rsquo;s
business, the melancholy man&rsquo;s sanctuary, the stranger&rsquo;s
welcome, the inns-of-court man&rsquo;s entertainment, the
scholar&rsquo;s kindness, and the citizen&rsquo;s courtesy. It is the
study of sparkling wits, and a cup of comedy their book,
whence we leave them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(5) A fifth cause was the perpetuation of Wakes.
Complaints were made in all directions of their evil
tendency. The author of the <i>Life of John Bruen</i> (1641)
laments that &lsquo;Popery and Profannes, two sisters in evil,
had consented and conspired in this parish, as in many
other places, together to advance their idols against the
arke of God, and to celebrate their solemne feastes of
their Popish saints by their wakes and vigils, ... in
all riot and excesse of eating and drinking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The outcry, it is evident, arose rather from the
Puritan than the Temperance party, and became so
irrepressible that at the Exeter assizes (1627), Chief
Baron Walter and Baron Denham made an order for
suppression of all wakes. Judge Richardson made a
like order for the county of Somerset, 1631. But on
Laud&rsquo;s demurrer the King commanded this order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> to be
reversed; which the judge declining to do, a report was
required by the bishop of the diocese how the feast days,
church-ales, wakes, and revels were observed within his
jurisdiction. On receipt of these instructions the bishop
advised with seventy-two of the most able of his clergy,
who certified that on these feast days the service of God
was more solemnly performed than on any other days,
that the people desired their continuance, as did also the
ministers, for that they preserved the memorial of the
dedication of their several churches, civilised the people,
composed differences, tended to the increase of love and
unity, and to the relief of the poor. On the delivery of
this certificate Judge Richardson was cited, and peremptorily
commanded to reverse his former order. After
this, King Charles I. gave new force to his father&rsquo;s
declaration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We do ratify and publish this our blessed father&rsquo;s decree, the
rather because of late, in some counties of our kingdom, we find
that under pretence of taking away abuses there hath been a general
forbidding, not only of ordinary meetings, but of the feasts of the
dedications of the churches, commonly called <i>Wakes</i>. Now his
Majesty&rsquo;s express will and pleasure is that these feasts, with others,
shall be observed; and that his justices of the peace shall look to it,
both that all disorders there may be prevented or punished, and
that all neighbourhood and freedom, with manlike and lawful
exercises, be used.</p></div>

<p>It should here be stated that malice even has not
dared to impeach the private morals of Charles I.
Chaste and temperate are epithets constantly applied to
him. The most convincing testimony to the latter virtue
is the statement of A. Wood, that the vintners illuminated
at his death, made bonfires, and drank lusty
carouses. He had evidently not favoured their trade;
but the justice of his cause and the injustice of his
treatment were engraven on many a publican&rsquo;s sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>, to
which the &lsquo;Mourning Crown and Mitre&rsquo; bore witness.
<i>The Mourning Bush</i> was the sign set up by John
Taylor, the &lsquo;Water-Poet,&rsquo; over his tavern in Long Acre,
to express his grief at the beheading of the King. But
he was compelled to away with it; when, in its place, he
put up the <i>Poet&rsquo;s Head</i>, his own portrait, with this
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
There is many a head hangs for a sign,<br />
Then, gentle reader, why not mine?<br />
</p>

<p>The following is the testimony of Clarendon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As he (the king) excelled in all other virtues, so in temperance
he was so strict, that he abhorred all debauchery to that degree,
that at a great festival solemnity, where he once was, being told by
one who withdrew from thence, what vast draughts of wine they
drank, and that there was one earl who had drunk most of the rest
down, and was not himself moved or altered, the king said that he
deserved to be hanged; and that earl coming shortly after into the
room where his Majesty was, in some gaiety, to show how unhurt
he was from that battle, the king sent one to bid him withdraw
from his Majesty&rsquo;s presence; nor did he in some days after appear
before him.</p></div>

<p>The following lines occur on the signboard of the
inn near Hardwicke House, close to Caversham, where
Charles I. was kept a prisoner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Stop! traveller, stop! In yonder peaceful glade<br />
His favourite game the Royal Martyr played:<br />
Here, stripped of honours&mdash;children&mdash;freedom&mdash;rank,&mdash;<br />
Drank from the bowl, and bowled for what he drank;<br />
Sought in a cheerful glass his cares to drown,<br />
And changed his guinea, ere he lost his crown.<br />
</p>

<p>But, along with so many incentives to excess, were
there no counteractive agencies at work? Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>e reply is
that there were. Precept and law were neither silent
nor inoperative. It was not for nothing that men like
Jeremy Taylor and Usher, Milton and Crashaw, lived
and wrote.</p>

<p>Of the first-named writer (chaplain to the king) two
quotations must suffice.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Jeremy Taylor on Temperance.</i>&mdash;Temperance hath an effect on
the understanding, and makes the reason sober, and the will orderly,
and the affections regular, and does things beside and beyond their
natural and proper efficacy: for all the parts of our duty are
watered with the showers of blessing, and bring forth fruit according
to the influence of heaven, and beyond the capacities of nature.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><i>Jeremy Taylor on our Shortening our own Days.</i>&mdash;In all the
process of our health we are running to our grave: we open our
own sluices by viciousness and unworthy actions; we pour in drink
and let out life; we increase diseases and know not how to bear
them; we strangle ourselves with our own intemperance; we suffer
the fevers and the inflammations of lust, and we quench our souls
with drunkenness: we bury our understandings in loads of meat
and surfeits, and then we lie down on our beds, and roar with pain
and disquietness of our souls.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></div>

<p>Archbishop Usher, treating of the seventh commandment,
asks,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>How is this commandment broken in the abuse of meat and
drink? Either in regard of the <i>quality</i> or <i>quantity</i> thereof. How
in regard of the <i>quantity</i>? By excess, and intemperance in diet:
when we ... give ourselves to surfeiting and drunkenness. What
be the contrary duties here commanded? 1. Temperance, in using
a sober and moderate diet, according to our ability.... 2. Convenient
abstinence (1 Cor. ix. 27).<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p></div>

<p>Of Milton, Johnson says that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>His domestic habits, so far as they are known, were those of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>severe student. He drank little strong drink of any kind, and fed
without excess in quantity, and in his earlier years without delicacy
of choice.</p></div>

<p>But we should certainly infer, <i>pace</i> the good Doctor,
that in his earlier years at least he was fond of wine,
from his sonnet to Mr. Lawrence, which seems redolent
of Horace in his Bacchanalian moods. The sonnet is
intensely classical:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Mr. Lawrence.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now that the fields are dank and ways are mire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire</span><br />
Help waste a sullen day, what may be won<br />
From the hard season gaining? Time will run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire</span><br />
The lily and rose, that neither sow&rsquo;d nor spun.<br />
What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Attic taste, <i>with wine</i>, whence we may rise</span><br />
To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>He who of those delights can judge, and spare</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To interpose them oft</i>, is not unwise.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Also in <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> we are rather disposed to think our
poet shows that he was not altogether superior &lsquo;to the
spicy nut-brown ale.&rsquo; On the other hand, his&mdash;also
Horatian&mdash;sonnet to Cyriac Skinner seems to suggest a
somewhat similar idea to Cowper&rsquo;s &lsquo;cups that cheer but
not inebriate,&rsquo; though they may refer to moderate
drinking:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Cyriac Skinner.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Cyriac, whose grandsire, on the royal bench<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of British Themis, with no mean applause</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pronounced and in his volumes taught our laws,</span><br />
Which others at their bar so often wrench;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><i>To-day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>In mirth that after no repenting draws</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>On the other hand, he could be no friend to excess who
in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, book i., thus speaks of Belial:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br />
And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br />
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br />
And injury and outrage; and when night<br />
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br />
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br />
</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Intemperance on the earth shall bring</span><br />
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br />
Before thee shall appear!<br />
</p>

<p>What an advocate of <i>prohibition</i> was he who could
write,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What more foul common sin among us than drunkenness?
Who can be ignorant that if the importation of wine were forbid, it
would both clean rid the possibility of committing that odious vice,
and men might afterwards live happily and healthfully without the
use of intoxicating liquors!</p></div>

<p>Richard Crashaw, of whom it was writ,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Poet and saint! to thee alone are given<br />
The two most sacred names of earth and heaven,<br />
</p>

<p>reckons amongst his many efforts of genius, <i>Temperance,
or the Cheap Physician</i>, where, after ridiculing the
doctors&rsquo; mystic compositions, he asks,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And what at last shall gain by these?<br />
Only a costlier disease.<br />
That which makes us have no need<br />
Of physic, that&rsquo;s physic indeed.<br />
</p>

<p>It may be remembered that this poet was the author
of the epigram whose last line runs,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.</span><br />
The modest water saw its God, and blushed.<br />
</p>

<p>This epigram was composed by Crashaw when
Dryden was an infant, so should not be attributed to the
latter.</p>

<p>Some noble lines of the poet James Nicholson are
well worthy of record:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Our homes are invaded with dark desolation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There&rsquo;s danger wherever the wine-cup doth flow;</span><br />
Then pledge your fair hands to resist the temptation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor stain your red lips with those waters of woe.</span><br />
Lift up your bright glances, put on all your beauty&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your holy affections&mdash;your God-given dower;</span><br />
Such weapons are mighty&mdash;awake to your duty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The trophies you gather will add to your power.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And, once more,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I&rsquo;ll pledge thee not in wassail bowl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With rosy madness filled;</span><br />
But let us quaff the nobler wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Nature&rsquo;s hand distilled.</span><br />
Where to the skies the mountains rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In grandeur to the view,</span><br />
Where sparkling rills leap down the hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Scotia&rsquo;s mountain dew.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thomas Weaver, 1649, writes,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The harms and mischiefs which th&rsquo;abuse<br />
Of wine doth every day produce,<br />
Make good the doctrine of the Turks,<br />
That in each grape a devil lurks.<br />
</p>

<p>Divines like Hugh Peters declaimed from the pulpit
against intemperance. Archbishop Harsnet, founder of
Chigwell School, left the regulation respecting the head
master, that he be &lsquo;no tippler, no haunter of ale-houses,
no puffer of tobacco.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In addition to abundance of precept, some legislative
action is noticeable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1627 (3 Charles I.) a fine of twenty shillings, or
whipping, is imposed for keeping an ale-house without
licence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1687 the vintners were called upon to submit to a
tax of a penny a quart upon all the wine they retailed.
As they repudiated the demand, a decree was passed in the
Star Chamber forbidding them to sell or dress victuals in
their houses. Two years after, they were questioned for
the breach of this decree, and to avoid punishment they
consented to lend the king six thousand pounds, subsequently
entering into a composition to pay half the duty
which was at first demanded of them.</p>

<p>An Act of 1688 prohibits the retailing of wine in
bottles&mdash;an Act which must have fostered adulteration.
Light wines will not keep long in the cask, and if not
bottled at the proper time become useless. The dealer,
to avert loss, adopts preventive measures. The door is
at once open to fraud and adulteration. Complaints of
the latter became now common.</p>

<p>Wines had risen greatly in price. <i>An order in Council
of 1633</i> directs that Canary, Muskadells, and Alligant
should be sold in gross at 17<i>l.</i> a pipe, and at 12<i>d.</i> the
quart by retail; Sacks and Malaga at 10<i>d.</i> the quart;
the best Gascoigne and French wines at 6<i>d.</i> the quart.</p>

<p>In 1643 was established the excise, which was introduced,
on the model of the Dutch prototype, by the
Parliament after its rupture with the Crown. Originally
established in 1643, its progress was gradual, being at
first laid upon those persons and commodities where it
was supposed that the shoe would least pinch&mdash;viz. the
makers and venders of ale, beer, cider, and perry. The
Royalists at Oxford followed the example set them at
Westminster, and imposed a similar duty; both sides protesting
that it should be continued no longer than <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>to the
end of the war, and then be abolished. But the Parliament
soon after extended its application to many other
commodities, and in course of time these champions of
liberty declared the impost of excise to be the most easy
and indifferent levy that could be laid upon the people,
and so continued it during their usurpation. It was afterwards
made hereditary to the Crown. Mr. Pymme is
considered to have been the father of this impost.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Doubtless there was great occasion for the committee
of 1641, which inquired into the general state of
the clergy. That there was intemperance in many
quarters cannot be denied; but something must be put
down to the spirit of the time. Drink was an accessory
of everything, and self-restraint was not a constant
factor; there could be only one result. The tree was
bad, the fruit was bad. That the following extract is
now regarded as a curiosity, is itself a proof of very
altered manners. The items are taken from the Darlington
parochial registers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1639. For Mr. Thompson that preached the forenoon and
afternoon, for a quart of sack, 14<i>d.</i> 1650. For six quarts of sack
to the minister that preached when we had not a minister, 9<i>s.</i>
1666. For one quart of sack bestowed on Mr. Gillet, when he
preached, 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> 1691. For a pint of brandy, when Mr. George
Bell preached here, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; when the Dean of Durham preached
here, spent in a treat with him, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> For a stranger that
preached, a dozen of ale, 12<i>d.</i></p></div>

<p>We here pause for a moment to listen to some very
thoughtful remarks of Howell, contained in a long epistle
to Lord Cliffe, upon the subject of comparative drinkdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is without controversy that in the nonage of the world, men
and beasts had but one buttery, which was the fountain and river,
nor do we read of any vines or wines till two hundred years after
the flood; but now I do not know or hear of any nation that hath
water only for their drink, except the Japanese, and they drink it
hot too; but we may say that whatever beverage soever we make,
either by brewing, by distillation, decoction, percolation, or pressing,
it is but water at first; nay, wine itself is but water sublimed, being
nothing else but that moisture and sap which is caused either by
rain or other kind of irrigations about the roots of the vine, and
drawn up to the branches and berries by the virtual attractive
heat of the sun, the bowels of the earth serving as an alembic to that
end, which made the Italian vineyard-man (after a long drought,
and an extreme hot summer which had parched up all his grapes)
to complain, &lsquo;For want of water I am forced to drink water; if I had
water I would drink wine:&rsquo; it may also be applied to the miller,
when he has no water to drive his mills. The vine doth so abhor
cold, that it cannot grow beyond the 49th degree to any purpose;
therefore God and nature hath furnished the north-west nations
with other inventions of beverage. In this island the old drink was
ale, noble ale, than which, as I heard a great foreign doctor affirm,
there is no liquor that more increaseth the radical moisture, and
preserves the natural heat, which are the two pillars that support
the life of man. But since beer hath <i>hopped</i> in amongst us, ale
is thought to be much adulterated, and nothing so good as Sir John
Oldcastle and Smugg the smith was used to drink. Besides ale
and beer, the natural drink of part of this isle may be said to be
metheglin, braggot, and mead, which differ in strength according to
the three degrees of comparison. The first of the three, which is
strong in the superlative if taken immoderately, doth stupefy more
than any other liquor, and keeps a humming in the brain, which
made one say, that he loved not metheglin because he was used to
speak too much of the house he came from, meaning the hive.
Cider and perry are also the natural drinks of parts of this isle.</p></div>

<p>The condition of things underwent no material change
during the Commonwealth and Protectorate, notwithstanding
the special pleading of political partisanship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The state of morals in England and its capital is accurately
described in a letter to a French nobleman
during the Protectorate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is within this city [London] and in all the towns of
England which I have passed through, so prodigious a number of
houses where they sell a certain drink called ale, that I think a
good half of the inhabitants may be denominated ale-house keepers.
These are a meaner sort of <i>cabarets</i>. But what is more deplorable,
there the gentlemen sit and spend much of their time, drinking
of a muddy kind of beverage, and tobacco, which has universally
besotted the nation, and at which I hear they have consumed many
noble estates. As for other taverns London is composed of them,
where they drink Spanish wines, and other sophisticated liquors, to
that fury and intemperance, as has often amazed me to consider it.
But thus some mean fellow, the drawer, arrives to an estate, some
of them having built fair houses, and purchased those gentlemen
out of their possessions, who have ruined themselves by that base
and dishonourable vice of ebriety. And that nothing may be
wanting to the height of luxury and impiety of this abomination,
they have translated the organs out of their churches to set them
up in taverns; chanting their dithyrambics and bestial bacchanalias
to the tune of those instruments which were wont to assist them in
the celebration of God&rsquo;s praises, and regulate the voices of the
worst singers in the world, which are the English in their churches
at present.... A great error undoubtedly in those who sit at the
helm, to permit this scandal; to suffer so many of these taverns
and occasions of intemperance, such leeches and vipers, to gratify
so sordid and base a sort of people with the spoils of honest and
well-natured men. Your lordship will not believe me, that the
ladies of greatest quality suffer themselves to be treated in one of
these taverns, where a courtezan in other cities would scarcely
vouchsafe to be entertained. But you will be more astonished when
I shall assure you that they drink their crowned cups roundly,
strain healths through their smocks, dance after the fiddle, &amp;c.
Drinking is the afternoon&rsquo;s diversion; whether for want of a
better, to employ the time, or affection to the drink, I know not.
But I have found some persons of quality whom one could not
safely visit after dinner, without resolving to undergo this drink-ordeal.
It is esteemed a piece of wit to make a man drunk, for
which some swilling insipid client or congiary is a frequent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
constant adjutant.</p></div>

<p>And later on, in order to contrast the two countries,
the writer adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, my lord, ever to have known (or very rarely)
a health drank in France, no, not the King&rsquo;s; and if we say, <i>à votre
santé, Monsieur</i>, it neither expects pledge or ceremony. &lsquo;Tis here
so the custom to drink to every one at the table, that by the time a
gentleman has done his duty to the whole company, he is ready to
fall asleep, whereas with us, we salute the whole table with a single
glass only.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p></div>

<p>Other writers of the time notice the participation of
the women in the general drinking. M. Jorevin, another
French author, writes of a Worcester hotel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>According to the custom of the country, the landladies sup with
the strangers and passengers, and if they have daughters they are
also of the company, to entertain the guests at table with pleasant
conceits, where they drink as much as the men; but what is to me
the most disgusting in all this is, that when one drinks the health
of any person in company, the custom of the country does not
permit you to drink more than half the cup, which is filled up and
presented to him or her whose health you have drunk.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></div>

<p>John Evelyn tells of the execrable habit of making
servants drunk. He remarks, under date July 19,
1654:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Went back to Cadenham, and on the 19th to Sir Ed. Baynton&rsquo;s
at Spie Park, a place capable of being made a noble seate; but the
humorous old knight has built a long single house of 2 low stories
on the precipice of an incomparable prospect, and looking on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>bowling greene in the park. The house is like a long barne, and
has not a window on the prospect side. After dinner they went to
bowles, and in the meanetime our coachmen were made so exceedingly
drunk, that in returning home we escap&rsquo;d greate dangers.
This it seems was by order of the knight, that all gentlemen&rsquo;s
servants be so treated; but <i>the custome is a barbarous one, and
much unbecoming a knight, still lesse a Christian</i>.</p></div>

<p>The same sort of thing happened to Evelyn again,
March 18, 1669:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I went with Lord Howard of Norfolk to visit Sir William Ducie
at Charlton, where we din&rsquo;d; the servants made our coachmen so
drunk that they both fell off their boxes on the heath, <i>where we
were fain to leave them</i>, and were driven to London by two servants
of my Lord&rsquo;s. <i>This barbarous custom of making the masters
welcome by intoxicating the servants</i> had now the second time
happen&rsquo;d to my coachmen.</p></div>

<p>[The italics are not Evelyn&rsquo;s.]</p>

<p>A writer, by name Joseph Rigbie, slashingly exposes
intemperance and its incentives, the <i>tavern</i> and <i>toasting</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The tap-house fits them for a jaile,<br />
The jaile to the gibbet sends them without faile;<br />
For those that through a lattice sang of late<br />
You oft find crying through an iron grate.<br />
</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Yea every cup is fast to others wedged.<br />
They always double drink, they must be pledged.<br />
He that begins, how many so&rsquo;er they be,<br />
Looks that each one do drink as much as he.<br />
</p>

<p>And further on, to the same effect:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Oh! how they&rsquo;ll wind men in, do what they can,<br />
By drinking healths, first unto such a man,<br />
Then unto such a woman! Then they&rsquo;ll send<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>An health to each man&rsquo;s mistresse or his friend;<br />
Then to their kindreds or their parents deare,<br />
They needs must have the other jug of beere;<br />
Then to their captains and commanders stout,<br />
Who for to pledge they think none shall stand out;<br />
Last to the king and queen they&rsquo;ll have a cruse.<br />
Whom for to pledge they think none dare refuse.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a><br />
</p>

<p>&lsquo;We seem,&rsquo; wrote Reeve in his <i>Plea for Nineveh</i>,
quoted in Malcolm&rsquo;s <i>Manners and Customs of London</i>, i.
p. 286, &lsquo;to be steeped in liquors, or to be the dizzy
island. We drink as if we were nothing but sponges
... or had tunnels in our mouths.... We are the
grape-suckers of the earth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That the ignorant and thoughtless should have been
swept into this vortex of dissipation is not surprising,
but one marvels that a man of power, and in some sort
a philosopher, should have stooped to translate an utterly
frivolous and worthless poem of St. Amant, of which a
mere quotation is sickening:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Wine, my boy; we&rsquo;ll sing and laugh,<br />
All night revel, rant, and quaff;<br />
Till the morn stealing behind us,<br />

A cold lodging in the grave;<br />
When swift death shall overtake us,<br />
We shall sleep and none can wake us.<br />
Drink we then the juice o&rsquo; the vine,<br />
Make our breasts Lyæus&rsquo; shrine;<br />
Bacchus, our debauch beholding,<br />
By thy image I am moulding,<br />
Whilst my brains I do replenish<br />
With this draught of unmixed Rhenish;<br />
By thy full-branched ivy twine;<br />
By this sparkling glass of wine;<br />
By thy thyrsus so renowned,<br />
By the healths with which th&rsquo;art crowned;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
To thy frolic order call us,<br />
Knights of the deep bowl install us;<br />
And to shew thyself divine,<br />
Never let it want for wine.<br />
</p>

<p>It would be thoroughly to the liking of such a patient
that Dr. Tobias Whitaker (1638) should publish his
<i>Blood of the Grape</i>, &lsquo;proving the possibility of maintaining
Life from Infancy to Old Age without Sickness, by
the Use of Wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In point of sobriety the Cavaliers have often been
unfavourably contrasted with the Roundheads. The
evidence for this, apart from mere recrimination (which
in this case is a two-edged sword), has yet to be produced.
The manners of the two factions were doubtless diverse.
&lsquo;Your friends, the Cavaliers,&rsquo; said a Roundhead to a
Royalist, &lsquo;are very dissolute and debauched.&rsquo; &lsquo;True,&rsquo;
replied the Royalist, &lsquo;they have the infirmities of men;
but your friends the Roundheads have the vices of devils&mdash;tyranny,
rebellion, and spiritual pride.&rsquo; We would
fain hope that they were sober all round, and that
Cromwell&rsquo;s description of his troops was unassailable.
The mother of Cromwell set up the brewery at Huntingdon
which is still flourishing. It was this slight connection
with &lsquo;the trade&rsquo; which gained for Cromwell the
agnomen of &lsquo;the brewer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The story is told, &lsquo;a tradition&rsquo; (Hume), that one
day sitting at table, the Protector had a bottle of wine
brought him, of a kind which he valued so highly that
he must needs open the bottle himself; but, in attempting
it, the corkscrew dropt from his hand. Immediately
his courtiers and generals flung themselves on the floor
to recover it. Cromwell burst out laughing. &lsquo;Should
any fool,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;put in his head at the door, he
would fancy, from your posture, that you were seeking
the Lord, and you are only seeking a corkscrew.&rsquo; One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
sees here that Cromwell is addressing his &lsquo;men of religion.&rsquo;
There was much of it real or unreal; and a
curious monument of the fashion then prevalent of
giving sacred names to everything and everybody is
furnished by the tavern sign of the &lsquo;Goat and Compasses,&rsquo;
which reveals the naked truth that &lsquo;Praise God
Barebones&rsquo; preferred drinking his tankard of ale at the
tavern whose sign was &lsquo;God encompasseth us&rsquo; to any
other ale-house. On the other hand it should be noted
that, according to the late Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Letters and
Speeches of Cromwell</i>, &lsquo;the stories of his wild living while
in town ... rest exclusively on Carrion Heath.... Of
evidence that he ever lived a wild life about town, or elsewhere,
there exists no particle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The funeral of the Protector is thus described by Evelyn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It was the joyfullest funerall I ever saw, for there were none
that cried but dogs, while the soldiers hooted away with a barbarous
noise, drinking and taking tobacco in the streetes as they went.</p></div>

<p><i>Club</i> life was becoming more and more unfavourable
to sobriety. The &lsquo;Everlasting Club,&rsquo; instituted during
the Civil War, was especially bibulous and riotous. So
much so, that a good-for-nothing devotee of the bottle
was satirically dubbed a member of that club. A writer
cited by Timbs notes that &lsquo;since their first institution
they have smoked fifty tons of tobacco, drank thirty
thousand butts of ale, one thousand hogsheads of red
port, two hundred barrels of brandy, and <i>one</i> kilderkine
of small beer.&rsquo; They sat night and day, one party relieving
another. The fire was never allowed to go out,
being perpetuated by an old woman in the nature of a
Vestal. The delight of the members was in &lsquo;old catches
which they sang at all hours, to encourage one another
to moisten their clay, and grow immortal by drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>But Eastern products were soon to create a revolution
in the national diet. Sir Anthony Shirley, one of
the celebrated trio of brothers, travellers, when he arrived
at Aleppo in 1598, first tasted a drink that he described
as being made of a seed which will &lsquo;soon intoxicate the
brain,&rsquo; and which, though nothing toothsome, was wholesome:
this was <i>coffee</i>. In 1650 was opened at Oxford
the first coffee-house by Jacobs, a Jew, at the Angel, in
the parish of St. Peter in the East; and there it was,
by some who delighted in novelty, drunk. Hence the
antiquary Oldys is incorrect in stating that the use of
coffee in England was first known in 1657.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. Edwards, a Turkey merchant, brought from Smyrna to
London one Pasqua Rosee, a Ragusan youth, who prepared this
drink for him every morning. But the novelty thereof drawing too
much company to him, he allowed his said servant, with another of
his son-in-law, to sell it publicly, and they set up the first coffee-house
in London in St. Michael&rsquo;s Alley in Cornhill.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p></div>

<p>Of course it was a panacea for all ills. An original
handbill of Rosee&rsquo;s, headed, &lsquo;The Vertue of the Coffee
Drink,&rsquo; thus sounds its praises:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The quality of this drink is cold and dry; and though it be a
drier, yet it neither heats nor inflames more than hot posset. It so
encloseth the orifice of the stomach, and fortifies the heat within,
that it is very good to help digestion; and therefore of great use to
be taken about three or four o&rsquo;clock afternoon, as well as in the
morning. It much quickens the spirits, and makes the heart lightsome;
it is good against sore eyes, and the better if you hold your
head over it and take in the steam that way. It suppresseth fumes
exceedingly, and therefore is good against the headache, and will
very much stop any defluxion of rheums that distil from the head
upon the stomach, and so prevent and help consumptions and the
cough of the lungs. It is excellent to prevent and cure the dropsy,
gout, and scurvy.... It is better than any other drying drink for
people in years, or children that have any running humours upon
them, as the king&rsquo;s evil, &amp;c. It is a most excellent remedy against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>the spleen, hypochondriac winds, and the like. It will prevent
drowsiness.... It is observed that in Turkey, where this is generally
drunk, that they are not troubled with the stone, gout, dropsy,
or scurvy, and that their skins are exceeding clear and white. It is
neither laxative nor restringent.</p></div>

<p>And indeed its virtues must have been generally
conceded, for it became fashionable in the reign of
Charles II., and is thus alluded to by Pope, who attributes
to it an additional virtue:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Coffee, which makes the politician wise,<br />
And see through all things with his half-shut eyes.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The authors of the <i>History of Signboards</i> state that
the &lsquo;Rainbow,&rsquo; in Fleet Street, opposite Chancery Lane,
is the oldest coffee-house in London:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I find it recorded that one James Farr, a barber, who kept the
coffee-house, which is now the Rainbow, by the Inner Temple gate
(one of the first in England), was, in the year 1657, presented by
the inquest of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s in the West, for making and selling a
sort of liquor called Coffee, as a great nuisance and prejudice to the
neighbourhood, &amp;c., and who would have thought London would
ever have had near three thousand such nuisances, and that coffee
would have been (as now) so much drank by the best of quality and
physicians.</p></div>

<p>The presentation here alluded to is still preserved
among the records of St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s church. It says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We present James Farr, barber, for making and selling a drink
called coffee, whereby, in making the same, he annoyeth his neighboors
by evill smells, and for keeping of fire the most part night
and day, whereby his chimney and chamber has been set on fire,
to the great danger and affreightment of his neighboors.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></div>

<p>Roger North, attorney-general to James II., says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>The use of coffee-houses seems newly improved by a new invention
called chocolate houses, for the benefit of rooks and cullies
of all the quality; where gaming is added to all the rest, ... as if
the devil had erected a new university, and those were the colleges
of its professors, as well as his school of discipline.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p></div>

<p>Chocolate was advertised as a new drink in 1657:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In Bishopsgate Street in Queen&rsquo;s Head Alley, at a Frenchman&rsquo;s
house, is an excellent West India drink called chocolate to be sold,
where you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade, at
reasonable rates.</p></div>

<p>The reputation of chocolate upon its introduction
was fluctuating. This appears in the letters of Madame
de Sévigné, who at one time recommends it to her
daughter with all fervour, whilst at other times she
decries it as the root of all evil.</p>

<p>But however much the introduction into our country
of such drinks was destined to discover a rival to intoxicants,
the fact remains that the public taste had
by the habit of long ages become vitiated, and England
had earned for herself the distinction of the &lsquo;land
of drunkards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>True it is that the Protector strove to repress intemperance
by fines and punishments. The rigid restrictions
of the republican rule were manifested in the
strict surveillance maintained over the people, with the
view of securing temperance. Convictions for drunkenness
were of daily occurrence; and it was often the
practice to remove all doubts of the sufficiency of testimony
by producing the delinquent in court under the
influence of drink. Many are the instances in which it
is recorded by the convicting justice that some offender
was &lsquo;drunk in my view.&rsquo; They were in the habit, moreover,
of making nice distinctions as to the grades of
intoxication.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;drunkard&rsquo;s cloak&rsquo; was an instrument of punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>then in use, which might with advantage be revived.
It was a cask with a hole at the top, through
which the drunkard&rsquo;s head protruded, and one on each
side for either hand. The legs were free for the offender to
perambulate with the instrument of disgrace about him.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Some strong language was uttered from the pulpit
against drunkenness. Dr. Robert Harris, President of
Trinity College, Oxford, in the dedication to the <i>Drunkard&rsquo;s
Cup</i>, a sermon, speaks of the <i>ars bibendi</i> as having
become a great profession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are lawes and ceremonies to be observed both by the firsts
and seconds. There is a drinking by the <i>foot</i>, by the <i>yard</i>, &amp;c., a
drinking by the <i>douzens</i>, by the <i>scores</i>, &amp;c., for the <i>wager</i>, for the
<i>victory</i>, <i>man against man</i>, <i>house against house</i>, <i>town against town</i>.
There are also terms of art, fetched from hell, for the better distinguishing
of the practitioners; one is <i>coloured</i>, another is <i>foxt</i>, a
third is <i>gone to the dogs</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>In the sermon he speaks of &lsquo;the strange saucinesse
of base vermine, in tossing the name of his most excellent
Majesty in their foaming mouthes, and in daring to
make that a shooing-horne to draw on drink by drinking
healths to him.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Grindrod draws attention in his <i>Bacchus</i> to a
prominent appeal of about the same date entitled, <i>The
Blemish of Government, the Shame of Religion, the Disgrace
of Mankind</i>: &lsquo;or, a charge drawn up against Drunkards,
and presented to his highness the Lord Protector, in the
name of all the sober party in the three nations,&rsquo; by
R. Younge. The book is not procurable; but assuming
the quotation to be correct the statistic is astounding:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is sad to consider how many will hear this charge for one
that will apply it to himself, for confident I am that fifteen of
twenty, this city over [London] are <i>drunkards</i>, yea, seducing
drunkards, in the dialect of Scripture, and by the law of God which
extends to the heart and the affections.... Perhaps by the law of
the land, a man is not taken for drunk except his eyes stare, his
tongue stutter, his legs stagger; but by God&rsquo;s law, he is one that
goes often to the drink, or that tarries long at it (Prov. xxiii. 30, 31).
He that will be drawn to drink when he hath neither <i>need of it</i>
nor <i>mind to it</i>, to the spending of <i>money</i>, wasting of precious <i>time</i>,
discredit of the <i>Gospel</i>, the stumbling-block of <i>weak ones</i>, and
hardening associates ... is a drunkard.</p></div>

<p>Presuming that Younge&rsquo;s statement is at all within
the mark, it will account for the effort put forth at the
London sessions in 1654, wherein it was ordered that
&lsquo;no new licences shall be granted for two years.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Great was the magnificence of the pageant upon the
restoration of King Charles II. The conduits flowed
with a &lsquo;variety of delicious wines.&rsquo; At the Stocks was
a fountain, of the Tuscan order, &lsquo;venting wine.&rsquo; The
event was commemorated at Charing Cross by the sign
of the Pageant Tavern, which represented the triumphal
arch there and then erected, and which remained some
time after. Various were the forms that exuberance
assumed. At the rejoicings at Edinburgh for the Restoration,
at the Lord Provost&rsquo;s return he was at every
bonfire complimented with the <i>breaking of glasses</i>&mdash;one
of the concomitant formalities of toasting.</p>

<p>Beyond the natural outburst of rejoicing at so great
an occasion, there is abundant corroboration of the
remark of Fosbroke, that &lsquo;drinking healths was <i>uncommonly</i>
prevalent, and productive of much intemperance,
immediately after and <i>on account of</i> t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>he Restoration.&rsquo;
Royalty will be always prominently recognised at our
public rejoicings, as a matter of course, and of right.
May the health of the Sovereign and Royal Family
always be proposed! Always, when the concomitant of
<i>drinking it</i> has become obsolete.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> What a volume could
be written on the customs which have gathered about
the toasting of our monarchs alone! One of these comes
at once to mind in connection with the Second Charles.
Pepys, in his <i>Diary</i> (1662-3), describes his own dining
at &lsquo;Chirurgeons&rsquo; Hall.&rsquo; He tells that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Among other observables we drunk the King&rsquo;s health out of a
gilt cup given by King Henry VIII. to this Company, with bells
hanging at it, which every man is to ring by shaking after he hath
drunk up the whole cup.</p></div>

<p>Another curious circumstance will be mentioned presently
in connection with the toasting his successor,
James.</p>

<p>But it is time again to review the material of all this
rejoicing. At this period of the seventeenth century
the importation of French wines into England was two-fifths
of her consumption.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Mr. Cyrus Redding states
that in 1675, there came to England 7,495 tuns of
French wine to 20 of those of Portugal; and in 1676 no
less than 9,645 French, to 83 Portuguese; soon after
which date French wines were prohibited for seven
years.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Navarre wine, which the same author mentions
among other wines of the Basses Pyrénées as of good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>quality, was coming into fashion. Pepys mentions his
dining at Whitehall with the Duke of York, who did
&lsquo;mightily commend some new sort of wine lately found
out, called Navarr wine, which I tasted, and is, I
think, good wine.&rsquo; Bacharach was becoming a favourite
Rhenish wine. Redding tells that German writers pretend
that this Bacharach derived its name from the
deity of wine, a stone still existing in the river, which
they call Bacchus&rsquo; altar.</p>

<p>The famous author of <i>Hudibras</i> introduces us to the
names of some of these wines which had recently come
into vogue:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Those win the day that win the race;<br />
And that which would not pass in fights,<br />
Has done the feats with easy flights,<br />
Recover&rsquo;d many a desp&rsquo;rate campaign<br />
With Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champaign;<br />
Restor&rsquo;d the fainting high and mighty<br />
With brandy, wine, and <i>aqua vitæ</i>;<br />
And made &lsquo;em stoutly overcome<br />
With Bacchrach, Hockamore, and Mum.<br />
</p>

<p>What a satirist was Butler, of drink, drinkers,
everybody!</p>

<p>Of drink:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Drink has overwhelmed and drowned,<br />
Far greater numbers on dry ground,<br />
Of wretched mankind, one by one,<br />
Than e&rsquo;er the flood before had done.<br />
</p>

<p>Of drinkers&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> &lsquo;on a Club of Sots&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The jolly members of a toping club,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>Like pipestaves, are but hooped into a tub,<br />
And in a close confederacy link<br />
For nothing else but only to hold drink.<br />
</p>

<p>Of everybody (to whom he was politically opposed)&mdash;appealing
to the Muse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Thou that with ale, or viler liquors,<br />
Didst inspire Withers, Prynne, and Vickers,<br />
And force them, though it was in spite<br />
Of Nature, and their stars, to write.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Other light wines are sung of in John Oldham&rsquo;s
<i>Works</i> (1684):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Let wealthy merchants when they dine,<br />
Run o&rsquo;er their witty names of wine:<br />
Their chests of Florence and their Mont Alchine,<br />
Their Mants, Champaigns, Chablees, Frontiniacks tell;<br />
Their aums of Hock, of Backrag, and Mosell.<br />
</p>

<p>No wonder that the doctors complained that their
efforts would be fruitless to patch up constitutions so
utterly weather-beaten by heat and wet, as we find from
Sir Charles Sedley&rsquo;s <i>The Doctor and his Patients</i>, where
it is told of the family Æsculapius:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
One day he called &lsquo;em all together,<br />
And, one by one, he asked &lsquo;em whether<br />
It were not better by good diet<br />
To keep the blood and humours quiet,<br />
With toast and ale to cool their brains<br />
Than nightly fire &lsquo;em with Champains.<br />
</p>

<p>And whilst these wines were injurious to their bodies
they failed to give any real or permanent relief to their
minds, as even the licentious tragedian of the period,
Etheridge, admitted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
At the plays we are constantly making our court,<br />

</p>

<p>We obtain an incidental estimate of the market
price of French wine from the <i>Tatler</i>, No. 147, where
we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Upon my coming home last night, I found a very handsome
present of French wine left for me, as a taste&mdash;of 216 hogsheads
which are to be put to sale at 20<i>l.</i> a hogshead, at Garraway&rsquo;s
coffee-house, in Exchange Alley.</p></div>

<p>These wines were sold <i>by the candle</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the property
was put up by the auctioneer, an inch of candle was
lighted, and the last bidder when the light went out was
the purchaser.</p>

<p>English vineyards were still here and there attempted.
Thus Evelyn (<i>Diary</i>, 1655) &lsquo;went to see Col. Blount&rsquo;s
subterranean warren, and drank of the wine of his vineyard,
which was good for little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The consumption of French <i>Brandy</i> was very great,
and discontent was excited from the notion that the
country was suffering from the lack of encouragement to
home distillation; permission was accordingly granted
to a company to <i>distil brandy</i> from wine and malt.</p>

<p>Besides wine and brandy, ale was drunk in various
forms.</p>

<p>Chamberlayne states that in 1667 no less than
1,522,781 barrels of beer were brewed in the city of
London, each of them containing from 32 to 36 gallons,
and that the amount yearly brewed in London had since
risen to nearly 2,000,000 barrels; and that the excise
for London was farmed out for 120,000<i>l.</i> a year.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Jorevin de Rochefort, whose travels were published
at Paris in 1672, says:&mdash;&lsquo;The English beer is the best
in Europe&rsquo; (<i>Antiquarian Repertory</i>, vol. iv. p. 607). At
Cambridge he had a visit from the clergyman, &lsquo;during
which,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it was necessary to drink two or three
pots of beer during our parley; for no kind of business
is transacted in England without the intervention of
pots of beer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this time people frequently ate no supper but
took <i>buttered ale</i>, composed of sugar, cinnamon, butter,
and beer brewed without hops. It was put into a cup,
set before the fire to heat, and drunk hot.</p>

<p><i>Cider</i> was again coming into fashion. Butler (<i>Hudibras</i>)
tells of Sidrophel that he knew&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
... in what sign best sider&rsquo;s made.<br />
</p>

<p>The manufacture being of sufficient moment for reference
to astrology.</p>

<p>A new liquor now introduced from Brunswick was a
sort of strong beer called <i>Mum</i>, or, sometimes, <i>Brunswick
Mum</i>. The word has been derived from <i>mummeln</i>, to
mumble, or from the onomatop&oelig;ic <i>mum</i>, denoting silence,
and from Christian Mummer by whom it was first brewed.
It was brewed chiefly from malt made from wheat instead
of barley. Pope writes of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The clamorous crowd is hush&rsquo;d with mugs of mum,<br />
Till all, tuned equal, send a general hum.<br />
</p>

<p>This foreign drink was rivalled by Dorset beer.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we hear still of <i>Metheglin</i>. Pepys (1666)
describes his dining with the king&rsquo;s servants from meat
that came from his Majesty&rsquo;s table, &lsquo;with most brave
drink, cooled in ice; and I, drinking no wine, had
metheglin, for the king&rsquo;s own drinking, which did please
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>me mightilye.&rsquo; It was an article of excise.</p>

<p>A good deal has been made of what is termed the
<i>reaction</i> in morals after the republican spell. For instance,
Mr. Samuelson says (<i>Hist. of Drink</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>These extreme measures of repression on the part of the Puritans
led to the result which might be anticipated. They gave courage
to those who were anxious for the return of royalty, and reconciled
many to its reinstatement who would otherwise have struggled for
the maintenance of republican institutions; and when Charles II.
was once more safely enthroned, there followed a reaction in morals
which has left to that period the unenviable notoriety of being the
most corrupt and dissolute in the whole history of our country.</p></div>

<p>One would almost imagine from this, and kindred
statements, that vice was unknown to the Protector and
his adherents; whereas it is matter of history that
Cromwell&rsquo;s early life was dissolute and disorderly, and
that he consumed in gaming, drinking, debauchery, and
country riots, the more early years of his youth.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The
Roundheads liked ale as well as the Cavaliers. Does
not Pepys tell of Monk&rsquo;s troops (Feb. 13, 1659):&mdash;&lsquo;The
city is very open-handed to the soldiers; they are <i>most
of them drunk all day</i>&rsquo;? Surely, then, bias must have
possessed Lord Macaulay when he would have us believe
that &lsquo;in the Puritan camp no drunkenness was seen.&rsquo;
Some prefer the evidence of a contemporary.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> possible to contrast the Courts of the two
Charleses, and the contrast is terrible; but was no one
responsible besides Charles II. for his wandering life,
when he herded with inferiors? If he was a creature
of frailty and vice, he was also a creature of circumstance.</p>

<p>Thus much prefaced, let it be freely admitted that
drunkenness prevailed in every rank of society, and that
the king set the example. Mr. Samuelson adduces from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>Evelyn, as an instance, a supper given by the Duke of
Buckingham when the Prince of Orange was over on a
visit, on which occasion the king made the prince drink
hard (though he could not have required much making),
under the influence of which, the Dutchman broke
the windows of the chambers of the maids of honour,
with other mischiefs.</p>

<p>Nor does the famous story in the <i>Spectator</i> impress
us with his bias towards temperance. The king had
been dining with the Lord Mayor at Guildhall, where
his cups did not prevent his observing that conviviality
had occasioned familiarity; whereupon, with an abrupt
farewell, he left the banquet. The mayor pursued the
monarch, overtook him in the courtyard, and swore that
he should not go till they had &lsquo;drunk t&rsquo;other bottle!&rsquo;
The airy monarch looked kindly at him over his shoulder,
and, with a smile and graceful air, repeated the line of
the old song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
And the man that is drunk is as great as a king!<br />
</p>

<p>and immediately turned back and complied with his
host&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<p>But the veil is more thoroughly lifted by Pepys,
who notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>September 23, 1667.</i>&mdash;With Sir H. Cholmly to Westminster;
who by the way told me how merry the King and Duke of York
and Court were the other day, when they were abroad a-hunting.
They came to Sir G. Cartaret&rsquo;s house at Cranbourne, and there
were entertained and all made drunk; and, being all drunk, Armerer
did come to the king, and swore to him &lsquo;By God, sir,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you
are not so kind to the Duke of York of late as you used to be.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Not I?&rsquo; says the king. &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if you are,
let us drink his health.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why let us,&rsquo; says the king. Then he
fell on his knees and drank it; and having done, the king <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>began to
drink it. &lsquo;Nay, sir,&rsquo; says Armerer, &lsquo;by God, you must do it on
your knees!&rsquo; So he did, and then all the company: and having
done it, all fell a-crying for joy, being all maudlin and kissing one
another, the king the Duke of York, and the Duke of York the king;
and in such a maudlin pickle as never people were: and so passed
the day.</p></div>

<p>Again he writes (1661):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At Court things are in very ill condition, there being so much
emulacion, poverty, and the vices of drinking, swearing, and loose
amours, that I know not what will be the end of it but confusion.</p></div>

<p>Two of the notables about Court have already been
alluded to. Rochester&mdash;that is, John Wilmot, Earl of
Rochester&mdash;in the language of Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;blazed out
his youth and his health in lavish voluptuousness,&rsquo; dying
at the age of thirty-three. Some lines of his favour
the notion that the origin of the term <i>toasting</i>, as given
in the <i>Tatler</i>, may be the correct one. They are:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Make it so large that, fill&rsquo;d with sack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up to the swelling brim,</span><br />
Vast <i>toasts</i> on the delicious lake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like ships at sea, may swim.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A confirmation of the same may be derived from a
verse of Warton:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
My sober evening let the tankard bless,<br />
With <i>toast</i> embrown&rsquo;d, and fragrant nutmeg fraught,<br />
While the rich draught, with oft-repeated whiffs,<br />
Tobacco mild improves.<br />
</p>

<p>Of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, the criticism
of Dryden must suffice&mdash;lines well known:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,<br />
Was everything by starts and nothing long.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>But in the course of one revolving moon,<br />
Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon.<br />
Then all for women, paintings, rhyming, drinking,<br />
Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.<br />
</p>

<p>Another drinking notoriety was Charles Sackville,
Earl of Dorset (<i>n.</i> 1637, <i>ob.</i> 1684).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One of his frolics [says Dr. Johnson] has by the industry of
Wood come down to posterity. Sackville, who was then Lord
Buckhurst, with Sir Charles Sedley and Sir Thomas Ogle, got drunk
at the Cock in Bow Street, by Covent Garden, and going into the
balcony utterly disgraced themselves. The public indignation was
awakened; the crowd attempted to force the door, and being repulsed
drove in the performers with stones, and broke the windows
of the house. For this misdemeanour they were indicted, and
Sedley was fined five hundred pounds: what was the sentence of
the others is not known. Sedley employed Killigrew and another
to procure a remission from the king; but (mark the friendship of
the dissolute) they begged the fine for themselves, and exacted it to
the last groat.</p></div>

<p>Lord Macaulay, in his <i>History of England</i>, chap. vi.
has the following description of the same disgraceful
event:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The morals of Sedley were such as even in that age gave great
scandal. He on one occasion, after a wild revel, exhibited himself
without a shred of clothing in the balcony of a tavern near Covent
Garden, and harangued the people who were passing in language so
indecent and profane that he was driven in by a shower of brickbats,
was prosecuted for a misdemeanour, was sentenced to a heavy fine,
and was reprimanded by the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench in the most
cutting terms.</p></div>

<p>It is perfectly clear that the higher motives for restraint
were lacking, though expediency acted as a curb
upon occasions. The following passage from Evelyn&rsquo;s
<i>Diary</i> will serve as an illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>October 30, 1682.</i>&mdash;I was invited to dine with Mons. Lionberg,
the Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it
being the birthday of his king. There dined the Duke of Alb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>emarle,
D. of Hamilton, Earle of Bathe, E. of Aylesbury, Lord Arran,
Lord Castlehaven, the sonn of him who was executed 50 yeares
before, and several greate persons. I was exceeding afraide of
drinking (it being a Dutch feast), <i>but the Duke of Albemarle, being
that night to waite on his Majestie, excesse was prohibited</i>; and
to prevent all, I stole away and left the company as soone as we
rose from table.</p></div>

<p>[Italics not in the original.]</p>

<p>From the same author we find that the same vice
beset women of rank. The Duchess of Mazarine, he
observes, is reported to have hastened her death by
intemperate drinking of strong spirits.</p>

<p>The Lower House of Parliament seems to have been
infected with the moral distemper. Evelyn writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>December 19, 1666.</i>&mdash;Among other things Sir R. Ford did make
me understand how the House of Commons is a beast not to be
understood, it being impossible to know beforehand the success
almost of any small plain thing.... He did tell me, and so did
Sir W. Batten, how Sir Allen Brodericke and Sir Allen Apsly did
come drunk the other day into the House, and did both speak for
half an hour together, and could not be either laughed, or pulled, or
bid to sit down and hold their peace, to the great contempt of the
king&rsquo;s servants and cause; which I am grieved at with all my
heart.</p></div>

<p>(What made this worse was that Sir Allen Brodericke
was an official&mdash;Surveyor-General in Ireland to his
Majesty.)</p>

<p>But there was a vast amount of drinking that is
really intemperance, though it passes under another
name. Very apposite are the words of a contemporary,
Sir William Temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Temperance, that virtue without pride, and fortune without
envy; ... the best guardian of youth, and support of old age; the
precept of reason as well as religion; and physician of the soul as
well as the body; the tutelar goddess of health, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>d universal
medicine of life, that clears the head and cleanses the blood, that
eases the stomach, and purges the bowels, that strengthens the
nerves, enlightens the eyes, and comforts the heart; in a word,
that secures and perfects the digestion.... I do not allow the
pretence of temperance to all such as are seldom or never drunk, or
fall into surfeits; for men may lose their health without losing
their senses, and be intemperate every day, without being drunk
perhaps once in their lives; nay, for aught I know, if a man should
pass the month in a college diet, without excess or variety of meats
or of drinks, but only the last day give a loose in them both, and so
far till it comes to serve him for physic rather than food, and he
utter his stomach as well as his heart, he may perhaps, as to the
mere considerations of health, do much better than another that
eats every day ... in plenty and luxury, with great variety of
meats, and a dozen glasses of wine at a meal, still spurring up appetite
when it would lie down of itself; flushed every day, but never
drunk.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p></div>

<p>It is refreshing in reading Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i> to come
upon a poet really free from a suspicion of fondness for
drink. Such a one was Edmund Waller, born 1605,
died 1687. Would he have lived so long had he been a
drink-hard? Johnson remarks of him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the first parliament summoned by Charles the Second
(March 8, 1661) Waller sat for Hastings, in Sussex, and served for
different places in all the parliaments of that reign. In a time
when fancy and gaiety were the most powerful recommendations to
regard, it is not likely that Waller was forgotten. He passed his
time in the company that was highest both in rank and wit, from
which even his obstinate sobriety did not exclude him. Though he
drank water, he was enabled by his fertility of mind to heighten the
mirth of Bacchanalian assemblies; and Mr. Saville said that &lsquo;no
man in England should keep him company without drinking but
Ned Waller.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>An excellent companion for the poet would have been
Guy, Earl of Warwick, in whose &lsquo;Tragical History&rsquo; occur
the lines:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquote">
<i>Phillis.</i> Give me some bread. I prithee, father, eat.<br />
<br />
<i>Guy.</i> Give me brown bread, for that&rsquo;s a pilgrim&rsquo;s meat.<br />
<br />
<i>Phillis.</i> Reach me some wine; good father, taste of this.<br />
<br />
<i>Guy.</i> Give me cold water, that my comfort is.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">I tell you, Lady, your great Lord and I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Have thought ourselves as happy as a king,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">To drink the water of a christal spring.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Coffee</i> came into general use in England, according
to John Evelyn (<i>Diary</i>), about 1667. But he records,
under date May 1637, that &lsquo;one Nathaniel Conopios, out
of Greece, from Cyrill, the Patriarch of Constantinople,
was the first he ever saw drink coffee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tea became a fashionable beverage in England soon
after the marriage of Catharine of Braganza with
Charles II. It was not exactly introduced by her, as it
was procurable in London some months, at any rate,
before her marriage; for Pepys writes:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Sept. 28, 1660.</i>&mdash;I
did send for a cup of tea (a China drink), of which
I never had drank before.&rsquo; Yet she set the fashion for
the use of it. Strickland rightly considers that the use
of these simple luxuries, tea, coffee, and chocolate, had
gradually a beneficial influence on the manners of all
classes of society, by forming a counter-charm against
habits of intoxication. Waller wrote a complimentary
poem on the queen, commending tea, in which are the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The best of Queens and best of herbs we owe<br />
To that bold nation, who the way did show<br />
To the fair region where the sun doth rise.<br />
</p>

<p>All sorts of things have been scribbled about it, good,
bad, and indifferent. The same Waller writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The Muses&rsquo; friend, <i>Tea</i>, does our fancy aid,<br />
Repress the vapours which the head invade,<br />
An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>d keeps the palace of the soul serene.<br />
</p>

<p>Young could write, on the other hand:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<i>Tea</i>; how I tremble at thy fatal stream!<br />
As Lethe, dreadful to the love of fame.<br />
What devastations on thy banks are seen!<br />
What shades of mighty names which once have been!<br />
A hecatomb of characters supplies<br />
Thy painted altars&rsquo; daily sacrifice.<br />
</p>

<p>In sympathy with Young would be Dr. Parr, in the
well-known line of gallantry:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Nec <i>tea</i>-cum possum vivere, nec sine te.<br />
</p>

<p>or, in mother tongue&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
When failing tea, my soul and body thrive,<br />
But failing thee, no longer I survive.<br />
</p>

<p>The epigram is still more severe:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
If wine be poison, so is Tea&mdash;but in another shape&mdash;<br />
What matter whether we are kill&rsquo;d by canister or grape?<br />
</p>

<p>We still plump for tea.</p>

<p>One word before leaving the drink of the Restoration.
Some may be curious to inquire the nature of their cups.
Pepys, telling of his dining at the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s banquet,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Plenty of wine of all sorts; but it was very unpleasing that we
had no napkins nor change of trenchers, and drunk out of earthen
pitchers and wooden dishes (cups).</p></div>

<p>Chaffers remarks that probably pitchers and large
pots were usually made of earth and leather, while the
cups, or dishes, out of which the liquor was drunk, were
of ash; or sometimes, among the more opulent, from
cups or tankards of silver:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
His cupboard&rsquo;s head six earthen pitchers graced,<br />
Beneath them was his trusty tankard placed.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 13em;">Dryden&rsquo;s <i>Juvenal</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It may be here mentioned that Dryden immensely
prided himself on his Bacchanalian song entitled
<i>Alexander&rsquo;s Feast</i>. He wrote to his publisher, &lsquo;I am
glad to hear from all hands that my ode is esteemed
the best of all my poetry.&rsquo; Stanza III. is a sufficient
specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The praise of Bacchus then the sweet Musician sung,<br />
Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:<br />
The jolly god in triumph comes;<br />
Sound the trumpets; beat the drums!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Flush&rsquo;d with a purple grace</span><br />

</p>

<p class="center"><i>Legislation.</i></p>

<p>The Wine Acts of Car. II. were those known as 12
Charles and 22 &amp; 23 Charles. Early in his reign he
issued that remarkable proclamation, which could not
but reflect on his favourite companions and strongly
mark the moral disorders of those depraved times.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It
is against &lsquo;vicious, debauch&rsquo;d, and profane persons,&rsquo; who
are thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A sort of men of whom we are sufficiently ashamed, who spend
their time in taverns, tippling-houses, and debauches, giving no
other evidence of their affection to us but in drinking our health,
and inveighing against all others who are not of their ow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>n dissolute
temper; and who in truth have more discredited our cause by the
license of their manners and lives, than they could ever advance it
by their affection or courage. We hope all persons of honour, or in
place and authority, will so far assist us in discountenancing such
men, that their discretion and shame will persuade them to reform
what their conscience would not; and that the displeasure of good
men towards them may supply what the laws have not, and, it may
be, cannot well provide against; there being by the license and
corruption of the times, and the depraved nature of man, many
enormities, scandals, and impieties, which laws cannot well provide
against, which may, <i>by the example and severity of virtuous men,
be easily discountenanced and by degrees suppressed</i>.</p></div>

<p>Blackstone, speaking of the king&rsquo;s ordinary revenue,
observes that a seventh branch might also be computed
to have arisen from wine licences, or the rents payable
to the Crown by such persons as are licensed to sell wine
by retail throughout England, except in a few privileged
places. These were <i>first settled on the Crown</i> by the
statute 12 Car. II. c. 25, and, together with the hereditary
excise, made up the equivalent in value for the loss
sustained by the prerogative in the abolition of the
military tenures, and the right of pre-emption and purveyance;
but this revenue was abolished by 30 Geo. II.
c. 19, and an annual sum of upwards of 7,000<i>l.</i> per annum,
issuing out of the new stamp duties imposed on
wine licences, was settled on the Crown in its stead.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The prices of wines were fixed anew. By 12 Car. II.
it was provided that no canary, muskadel, or aligant, or
other Spanish or sweet wines, should be sold by retail
for over 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the quart; Gascoigne and French wines
limited to 8<i>d.</i> the quart, Rhenish wines to 12<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From the reign of the Norman kings here, to 1660, the wines of
Guienne, Poitou, and Gascony came in, subject to mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>derate dues,
until the reign of Charles II. The amount of duties by 12 Charles II.
c. 4, was 13<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per tun in London, and 16<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> in the out-ports.
This was at the rate of 13&frac14;<i>d.</i> the gallon. The trade with
France after the Revolution seems to have been carried on upon an
equitable footing until 1675, when one of those popular alarms that
often disgrace this country was raised, that France was ruining
us, for there was a balance of trade against us of 965,128<i>l.</i> Land
happened at the time to have fallen in price. The landed interest
was shipwrecked; all, it was averred, in consequence of the money
of England going over to France for the purchase of her productions.
Cries were uttered like those when the calendar was
rectified, &lsquo;Give us back our ten days,&rsquo; or the old &lsquo;No Popery,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
Church in danger,&rsquo; or more recently the cry of &lsquo;French invasion,&rsquo;
echoed from all sides, amid the shouts of the ignorant or interested.
England was on the brink of ruin, if they were to be credited. The
treaty of commerce concluded was soon hooted down, and in 1678,
Parliament, the wisdom of which used sometimes to be very
problematical, came to a vote declaring that the &lsquo;trade with France
was detrimental to the kingdom!&rsquo; An Act of absolute wisdom in
the legislative sense of that time followed, the preamble of which
ran, &lsquo;Forasmuch as it hath been by long experience found that the
importing French wines, brandy, silks, linen, salts, and paper, and
other commodities of the growth, product, or manufactures of the
territories and dominions of the French king, hath much exhausted
the treasure of this nation, lessened the value of the native commodities
and manufactures thereof, and caused great detriment to
this kingdom, &amp;c.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was also averred that, in consequence, rents fell. French
wine was therefore prohibited from 1679 to 1685.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p></div>

<p>We form an idea of the <i>Ingredients put into wines</i>
from the order of 12 Car. II. c. 25:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That no merchant, vintner, wine-cooper or other person, selling
or retailing any wine, shall mingle or utter any Spanish wine
mingled with any French wine, or Rhenish wine, cyder, perry,
stummed wine, honey, sugar, syrups of sugar, molasses, or any
other syrups whatsoever: nor put in any isinglass, brimstone, lime,
raisins, juice of raisins, water, nor any other liquor nor ingredients,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>nor any clary or other herbs, nor any sort of flesh whatsoever.</p></div>

<p>The excise duties on superior beer was 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; on
inferior, 3<i>d.</i>; on a hogshead of cider or perry, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>;
on a gallon of mead, &frac12;<i>d.</i>; on a gallon of aqua-vitæ, 1<i>d.</i>;
on a gallon of coffee, 4<i>d.</i>; on a gallon of chocolate or
tea, 8<i>d.</i> In 1670, brandy had a duty imposed on it of
8<i>d.</i> a gallon when imported.</p>

<p>Upon the accession of</p>

<p class="center"><i>James II.</i></p>

<p>after the dinner at Guildhall, their Majesties were beset
with numerous crowds whose shouts declared their joy.
When they reached Ludgate, a rank of loyal gentlemen
stood in a balcony, charged with full glasses, which they
discharged in such excellent order, that caused all the
guards to answer them with a huzza!<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>John Evelyn was ordered by the sheriff to assist in
proclaiming the king. He thus describes the event:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I met the Sheriff and commander of the Kentish Troop, with an
appearance, I suppose, of above 500 horse and innumerable people,
two of his Majesty&rsquo;s trumpets, and a Sergeant with other officers,
who, having drawn up the horse in a large field neere the towne,
march&rsquo;d thence with swords drawne, to the Market Place, where,
making a ring after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High
Sheriff read the proclaiming titles to his Bailiffe, who repeated them
aloud, and then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty&rsquo;s
health being drunk in a flint glass of a yard long by the Sheriff,
commander, officers, and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed and I
returned.</p></div>

<p>Here is an answer to the question, &lsquo;What is a <i>yard
of ale</i>?&rsquo; Before the standard measures were in general
use, ale was measured out in this <i>ale-yard</i>, which was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>flint-glass a yard long, of sufficient capacity to admit a
saccharometer which was a test of its strength and quality.</p>

<p>Many of the old ceremonies observed at the coronation
banquets of the early kings were revived by James.
Amongst these, the following usage may be noted.
After thrice flinging down the gauntlet, the champion
made his obeisance to the king, who drank to him from
a gilt bowl, which he then returned with the cover.
The champion then pledged his Majesty, and rode out
of the hall, taking bowl and cover as his fee.</p>

<p>But such ceremonies are not to be taken as any
indication of a proneness of the king to high living.
Hard drinking he hated. A contemporary writes that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The king, going to Mass, told his attendants he had been
informed that since his declaring against the disorder of the household,
some had the impudence to appear drunk in the queen&rsquo;s
presence ... but he advised them at their peril to observe his
order, which he would see obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p></div>

<p>Much light has been thrown upon the general habits
of the period by Lord Macaulay, who, in describing the
English country gentleman of 1688, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>His chief serious employment was the care of his property. He
examined samples of grain, handled pigs, and on market days made
bargains over a tankard with drovers and hop merchants. His
chief pleasures were commonly derived from field sports, and from
an unrefined sensuality.... His table was loaded with coarse
plenty, and guests were cordially welcome to it. But as the habit
of drinking was general in the class to which he belonged, and as
his fortune did not enable him to intoxicate large assemblies daily
with claret or canary, strong beer was the ordinary beverage. The
quantity of beer consumed in those days was indeed enormous, for
beer then was to the middle and lower classes not only all that beer
now is, but all that wine, tea, and ardent spirits now are; it was
only at great houses, or on great occasions, that foreign drink was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>placed on the board. The ladies of the house, whose business it
had commonly been to cook the repast, retired as soon as the
dishes had been devoured, and left the gentlemen to their ale and
tobacco. The coarse jollity of the afternoon was often prolonged
till the revellers were laid under the table.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lecky observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Among the poor ... the popular beverage was still ale or beer,
<span class="smcap">the use of which</span>&mdash;especially before the art of noxious adulteration
was brought to its present perfection&mdash;<span class="smcap">has always been more common than the abuse</span>. The consumption appears to have been amazing. It
was computed in 1688 that no less than 12,400,000 barrels were
brewed in England in a single year, though the entire population probably
little exceeded 5,000,000. In 1695, with a somewhat heavier
excise, it sank to 11,350,000 barrels, but even then almost a third
part of the arable land of the kingdom was devoted to barley.</p></div>

<p>More bluntly, of course, than Macaulay, did that
scourge of iniquity, Jeremy Collier, express himself.
Satirising dinner invitations, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the invitation was sent in a letter, and the truth spoken out,
it must run in the tenor following: &lsquo;Sir, if you please to do me the
favour to dine with me, I shall do my best to drink you out of
your limbs and senses, to make you say a hundred silly things,
and play the fool to purpose, if ever you did it in your life. And
before we part you shall be well prepared to tumble off your horse,
to disoblige your coach, and make your family sick at the sight of
you. And all this for an opportunity of showing with how much
friendship and respect I am <i>your humble servant</i>.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>That the delights of the table were the one thing
needful is well illustrated by a cross-examination recorded
by Mr. Jeaffreson<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&lsquo;You know Lord Barrymore?&rsquo; Dr. Beaufort was asked by the
lords of the Privy Council. &lsquo;Intimately, most intimately,&rsquo; replied
the Doctor. &lsquo;You are continually with him?&rsquo; urged the questioner.
&lsquo;We dine together almost daily when his lordship <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>is in town.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What do you talk about?&rsquo; &lsquo;Eating and drinking.&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>And</i> what
else?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, my lord, we never talk of anything except eating and
drinking, drinking and eating.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The habit of <i>toasting</i> had much to do with the excesses
then so common. At the birth of the male heir
to the throne, claret was drunk at the expense of the
Crown, and endless glasses broken in drinking the health
of their Majesties and the Prince Stuart at the Edinburgh
town cross. Even the malcontent city of York
drank deep potations.</p>

<p>Rhyming toasts were then in fashion. A Court
gossip writes to Lady Rachel Russell:&mdash;&lsquo;I know not
whether you have heard a health that goes about, which
is new to me just now, so I send it you:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The King God bless,<br />
And each princess,<br />
The Church no less,<br />
Which we profess,<br />
As did Queen Bess.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>No doubt great abuses attended this habit of health-drinking,
or we should not find Dekker, Thomas Hall,
and, indeed, the moralists almost to a man, inveighing
against the custom. It was only a few years before this
reign that the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Matthew Hale,
left the injunction to his grandchildren:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I will not have you begin or pledge any health, for it is become
one of the greatest artifices of drinking and occasions of quarrelling
in the kingdom. If you pledge one health you oblige yourself to
pledge another, and a third, and so onward, and if you pledge as
many as will be drank, you must be debauched and drunk. If they
will needs know the reason of your refusal, it is a fair answer&mdash;that
your grandfather who brought you up, from whom under God you
have the estate you enjoy or expect, left this in command with you
that you should never begin or pledge a health.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>What a contrast does Justice Hale present to the
merciless Judge Jeffries, whose habitual intemperance
may account for his actions. Nor should it be forgotten
that Sir Henry Bellasyse, whose widow the king was so
anxious to marry, was killed in a duel whilst in a state
of intoxication.</p>

<p>A very important reminder is to be found in an Act
of 1685, to the effect that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The ancient true and principal use of ale-houses was for the
lodging of wayfaring people, and for the supply of the wants of
such as were not able by greater quantities to make their provisions
of victuals, and not for entertainment and harbouring of
lewd and idle people, to spend their time and money in a lewd and
drunken manner.</p></div>

<p>An event which occurred in this short reign immortalised
a roadside inn. <i>The Revolution House</i>, at
Whittington, obtained its name from the accidental
meeting of the Earl of Danby, the Earl of Devonshire,
Lord Delamere, and Mr. John D&rsquo;Arcy, one morning in
1688, on Whittington Moor, near Chatsworth, to consult
about the Revolution, then in agitation. A shower of
rain happening to fall, they removed to the village for
shelter, and finished their conversation at a public-house
called <i>The Cock and Pynot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>A fashionable spirit in this and the following reign
was Jamaica <i>Rum</i>. When the Duke of Monmouth was
being brought to London as a prisoner, in 1685, he took
for a bad cold, at Romsey, while staying on his saddle,
a hot glass of rum and eggs. Hot coffee would probably
have done him more good. We have already noticed
that it came into use in Charles II.&rsquo;s time. Sir Anthony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Shirley described it as made of a seed which, though
nothing toothsome, was wholesome. Pope went further,
writing in his <i>Rape of the Lock</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Coffee, which makes the politician wise,<br />
And see through all things with his half-shut eyes.<br />
</p>

<p>Upon the accession of</p>

<p class="center"><i>William III.</i></p>

<p>the usual pageant was observed in London. The conduits
ran with wine. The same reception greeted the
king shortly after at Oxford. The drinking habits of
the monarch are well known, though Evelyn speaks
of him as naturally averse to drink. After the death
of the queen, he became more addicted to his favourite
drink, Hollands gin. The banqueting-house at Hampton
Court, which was used by him as a drinking and
smoking room, has been described as a royal gin-temple.
Enemies he had in abundance, and so intense was their
hatred, that, in their hours of debauch, they drank to
the health of Sorrel, meaning the horse that fell with
the king, and, under the appellation of the &lsquo;little gentleman
in velvet,&rsquo; <i>toasted</i> the mole that raised the hill over
which the horse had stumbled.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Let us hope that it was
the same hostility that accused the queen of fondness for
drink. However this may be, it is certain that her
physicians warned her most plainly against a strong
spirituous cordial to which she resorted in large doses
when ill.</p>

<p>From highest to lowest intemperance raged in the
reign of William and Mary. De Foe remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the history of this well-bred vice was to be written, it would
plainly appear that it began among the gentry, and from them was
handed down to the poorer sort, who still love to be like their
betters. After the Restoration, when the king&rsquo;s health became the
distinction between a Cavalier and Roundhead, drunkenness began
to reign. The gentry caressed the beastly vice at such a rate that
no servant was thought proper unless he could bear a quantity of
wine; and to this day, when you speak well of a man, you say he is
an honest, drunken fellow&mdash;as if his drunkenness was a recommendation
to his honesty. Nay, so far has this custom prevailed, that
the top of a gentlemanly entertainment has been to make his
friend drunk, and the friend is so much reconciled to it that he
takes it as the effect of his kindness. The further perfection of this
vice among the gentry appears in the way of their expressing their
joy for any public blessing. &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; said a gentleman of very high
quality, when, after the debate in the House of Lords, King William
was voted into the vacant throne, &lsquo;Jack, go home to your lady, and
tell her we have got a Protestant king and queen, and go make a
bonfire as big as a house, and bid the butler make ye all drunk,
ye dog.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p></div>

<p>From highest to lowest, we repeat, intemperance
raged. Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, writing upon the
curse and terrorism of mendicancy, complains that many
thousands of beggars &lsquo;meet together in the mountains,
where they feast and riot for many days; and at country
weddings, markets, burials, and the like public occasions,
they are to be seen, both men and women, perpetually
drunk, cursing, blaspheming, and fighting together.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The dissoluteness of the time found its expression,
not only upon the stage, but among the actors themselves.
Terribly significant is the following note by
Derrick on a play written by Higden, to whom Dryden
wrote a poetical epistle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This gentleman (Henry Higden, Esq.) brought a comedy on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>stage in 1693, called <i>The Wary Widow, or Sir Noisy Parrot</i>,
which was damned, and he complains hardly of the ill-usage;
for the bear-garden critics treated it with cat-calls. It is printed
and dedicated to the courtly Earl of Dorset; Sir Charles Sedley
wrote the prologue, and it was ushered into the world with several
copies of verses. The audience were dismissed at the end of the
third act, the author having contrived so much drinking of punch
in the play, that the actors all got drunk, and were unable to
finish it.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p></div>

<p>Even the offices of religion enjoyed no immunity.
Apart from the annual item of &lsquo;communion wine,&rsquo; a by
no means uncommon charge upon the parish was &lsquo;wine
for the vestry.&rsquo; A dignitary of the Church, evidently of
the <i>Mapes</i> and <i>Still</i> species, thought it not beneath the
dignity of his office to compose the bibulous epigram:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Si bene commemini, causæ sunt quinque bibendi;<br />
Hospitis adventus; præsens sitis; atque futura;<br />
Et vini bonitas; et quælibet altera causa.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a><br />
</p>

<p>which has been rendered into English:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
If all be true that I do think,<br />
There are five reasons we should drink:<br />
Good wine, a friend, or being dry,<br />
Or lest we should be by-and-by,<br />
Or any other reason why.<br />
</p>

<p>Plenty of voices were raised against the current vice.
By far the most powerful warning was uttered by the
Rev. Dr. William Assheton, Fellow of Brasenose,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> who
opens his discourse thus fearlessly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Their Majesties, being sensible that as Righteousness exalteth a
nation, so sin is a reproach to any people; and being desirous to
reform the lives and manners of all their subjects, have commanded
the clergy to Preach frequently against those particular sins and
vices which are most prevailing in this realm&mdash;viz. against Blasphemy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Swearing, Cursing, Perjury, Drunkenness, and Prophanation
of the Lord&rsquo;s day.</p></div>

<p>He reminds that the Act of Parliament calls the sin of
drunkenness &lsquo;odious and loathsom.&rsquo; He urges:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The known ends of drink are these: the digestion of our meat,
chearfulness and refreshment of our spirits, and the preserving of
health. And whilst it contributes to those ends, so far Drinking is
regular and moderate; but when it destroys them, &lsquo;tis irregular and
sinful. When therefore wine or any other drink is taken in such
excess that by overloading nature it hinders digestion, drowns and
suffocates the spirits, disorders the faculties, hinders the free use of
reason, and thereby makes men unfit for business, and indisposeth
them either for civil or religious duties, then its use is irregular and
immoderate, and consequently sinful.</p></div>

<p>He refers to Isaiah v. 11, 22, Prov. xxiii. 29, Luke
xxi. 34, Rom. xiii. 13. He dilates on the sad consequence
of excess to soul, body, estate, and good name.
He asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What sin is so heinous which a man intoxicated may not
commit? The reason is plainly this: <i>Erranti terminus nullus</i>.
An intemperate man is under no conduct: he is neither under
God&rsquo;s keeping, nor his own. He hath quenched God&rsquo;s Spirit,
whilst he inflamed his own.</p></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When fancy is rampant, and sensual inclinations are let loose,
you little know what advantage the devil can make of such a
juncture.... Wine, if immoderately taken, is very Poyson, which,
though it destroys not immediately, yet kills as sure as the rankest
dose that was ever presented by Italian hand.</p></div>

<p>A medical writer, Dr. Richard Carr, inveighed, not
only against strong drink, but against tobacco, milk, and
nurses!<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> And something may even be learnt from the
once famous Tom Brown, classed by Thackeray with
Thomas D&rsquo;Urfey and Ned Ward, a writer of libels and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ribaldry, but a man of humour and learning, from
whose <i>Laconics</i> many a useful maxim may be culled.
The following extract is not unworthy of Joseph
Hall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If your friend is in want, don&rsquo;t carry him to the tavern, where
you treat yourself as well as him, and entail a thirst and headache
upon him next morning. To treat a poor wretch with a bottle of
Burgundy, or fill his snuff-box, is like giving a pair of lace ruffles
to a man that has never a shirt on his back. <i>Put something into
his pocket.</i></p></div>

<p>Before estimating the causes of the prevalent declension
of morals, it will be necessary to examine the legislation
at the close of this seventeenth century, with
which it was intimately associated.</p>

<p>Partly through hostility to France, and partly to
encourage the home distilleries, the Government of the
Revolution, in 1689, prohibited the importation of spirits
from all foreign countries, and threw open the distillery
trade, on payment of certain duties, to all its subjects.
These measures laid the foundation of the great extension
of the English manufacture of spirits.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Any person
was permitted to set up a distillery, on giving ten days&rsquo;
notice to the excise. The consequence of this was a
general thriving of the distillery business, with a corresponding
deterioration of the people. Indeed, legislative
modification was soon found to be absolutely
necessary to counteract the influence of these baneful
measures upon health, sobriety, and public order.</p>

<p>We scarcely wonder that the king enthusiastically
encouraged the new distilleries, although the measure
was a reversal of all previous policy. From the Norman
period downwards, the laws of the land had prohibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>the conversion of malt into spirit, except a trifling
quantity for medicinal uses. Elizabeth had so strictly
enforced this statute as to treat an infringement of it as
a moral offence.</p>

<p>A change so disastrous could not escape condemnation.
The discursive Whiston, in his autobiographical
Memoirs, laments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>An Act of Parliament has abrogated a very good law for discouraging
the poor from drinking gin; nay, they have in reality
encouraged men to drunkenness, and to the murder of themselves
by such drinking. Judge Hale earnestly supported the restrictive
law, and opposed its abrogation, declaring that millions of persons
would kill themselves by these fatal liquors.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></div>

<p>By the 5th &amp; 6th of William and Mary, the duties
were raised in 1694 to 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> on strong, and 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> on
table beer. In 1695, the Commons resolved that a sum
not exceeding 515,000<i>l.</i> should be granted for the support
of the civil list for the ensuing year, to be raised
by a malt tax, and additional duties upon mum, sweets,
cyder, and perry. In 1691, owing to the tension with
France, further supplies were raised by impositions
which included in their number a duty of sixpence a
bushel on malt, and a further duty on mum, cyder, and
perry.</p>

<p>The price of claret rose rapidly when war with
France broke out. Soon the clarets were exhausted.
A substitute had to be found, and was discovered in the
red wine of Portugal, then imported for the first time.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;Some claret, boy!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Indeed, sir, we have none.<br />
Claret, sir.&mdash;Lord! there&rsquo;s not a drop in town.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>But we have the best red port.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you call<br />
Red port?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A wine, sir, comes from Portugal;<br />
I&rsquo;ll fetch a pint, sir.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>The next quotation throws light upon its composition:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Mark how it smells. Methinks, a real pain<br />
Is by its odour thrown upon my brain.<br />
I&rsquo;ve tasted it&mdash;&lsquo;tis spiritless and flat,<br />
And has as many different tastes<br />
As can be found in compound pastes.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a><br />
</p>

<p>We are now in a position to determine the causes
of the prevalent intemperance at the close of the seventeenth
century:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Act to encourage distillation.</p>

<p>2. The exhaustion of light wines.</p>

<p>3. The influence of the Court.</p>

<p>4. The development of <i>toasting</i>.</p>

<p>5. Club life.</p>

<p>It remains only to notice the last two of the causes.</p>

<p><i>Toasting</i> was carried to an utter absurdity. Chamberlayne
thus accounts for the fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As the English, returning from the wars in the Holy Land,
brought home the foul disease of leprosy, ... so, in our fathers&rsquo;
days, the English, returning from service in the Netherlands,
brought with them the foul vice of drunkenness.... This vice at
present prevails so much that some persons, and those of quality,
may not safely be visited in an afternoon without running the
hazard of excessive drinking of healths (whereby, in a short time,
twice as much liquor is consumed as by the Dutch, who sip and
prate); and in some places it is esteemed a piece of wit to make a
man drunk, for which purpose some swilling insipid buffoon is
always at hand.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p></div>

<p>An observant Frenchman, M. Misson, who in 1698
published his observations on England and the English,
referred particularly to the custom of <i>toasting</i>&mdash;a custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>(as he declared) almost abolished amongst French people
of any distinction. He noticed that, with ourselves, to
have drunk at table without making it the occasion of a
toast would have been considered an act of gross discourtesy.
The mode of observing the ceremony was
that the person whose health was drunk remained perfectly
motionless from the moment his name was uttered
until the conclusion of the health. Or, as Misson sarcastically
describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If he is in the act of taking something from a dish, he must
suddenly stop, return his fork or spoon to its place, and wait,
without stirring more than a stone, until the other has drunk ...;
after which an <i>inclinabo</i>, at the risk of dipping his periwig in the
gravy in his plate. I confess that when a foreigner first sees these
manners he thinks them laughable. Nothing appears so droll as
to see a man who is in the act of chewing a morsel which he has
in his mouth, or doing anything else, who suddenly takes a serious
air, when a person of some respectability drinks to his health, looks
fixedly at his person, and becomes as motionless as if a universal
paralysis had seized him.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p></div>

<p>It is questionable if Misson was strictly correct in
stating that health-drinking had gone out in good
French society. Not long before this, Pepys had made
this entry in his <i>Diary</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To the Rhenish wine-house, where Mr. Moore showed me the
French manner when a health is drunk to bow to him that drunk
to you, and then apply yourself to him whose lady&rsquo;s health is
drunk, and then the person that you drink to&mdash;which I never knew
before; but it seems it is now the fashion.</p></div>

<p>On a sort of progress through the country that
William III. made in 1695, he was entertained, among
other places, at Warwick Castle, by Lord Brook. &lsquo;Guy&rsquo;s
Tower was illuminated. A cistern containing a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>and twenty gallons of punch was emptied to his Majesty&rsquo;s
health.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>A good specimen of the convivial songs of the Jacobites
at this time is to be found in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
collection. It is entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Three Healths.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">
To ane king and no king, ane <i>uncle</i> and father,<br />
To him that&rsquo;s all these, yet allowed to be neither;<br />
Come, rank round about, and hurrah to our standard;<br />
If you&rsquo;ll know what I mean, here&rsquo;s a health to our landlord!<br />
<br />
To ane queen and no queen, ane <i>aunt</i> and no mother,<br />
Come, boys, let us cheerfully drink off another;<br />
And now, to be honest, we&rsquo;ll stick by our faith,<br />
And stand by our landlord as long as we&rsquo;ve breath.<br />
<br />
To ane prince and no prince, ane son and no bastard,<br />
Beshrew them that say it! a lie that is fostered!<br />
God bless them all three; we&rsquo;ll conclude with this one,<br />
It&rsquo;s a health to our landlord, his wife, and his son.<br />
<br />
To our monarch&rsquo;s return one more we&rsquo;ll advance,<br />
We&rsquo;ve a king that&rsquo;s in Flanders, another in France;<br />
Then about with the health, let him come, let him come, then,<br />
Send the one into England, and both are at home then.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a><br />
</p>

<p>And, lastly, the <i>Clubs</i>. Such was their influence
that Doran even wrote:&mdash;&lsquo;The Clubs ... were the
chief causes that manners were as depraved as they
were.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But it must be remembered that they were
effect as well as cause. The Calves&rsquo; Head Club was
probably as bad as any. Out of a calf&rsquo;s skull filled with
wine, the company drank &lsquo;to the pious memory of those
worthy patriots who killed the tyrant.&rsquo; An anniversary
anthem was sung. That for the year 1697 concludes
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
Advance the emblem of the action,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fill the calf&rsquo;s skull full of wine;</span><br />
Drinking ne&rsquo;er was counted faction,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Men and gods adore the wine.</span><br />
To the heroes gone before us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let&rsquo;s renew the flowing bowl;</span><br />
While the lustre of their glories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shines like stars from pole to pole.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Another famous club was supposed to obtain its
name from the custom of pledging favourites after dinner.
Thus, Arbuthnot writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Whence deathless Kit-kat took his name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Few critics can unriddle;</span><br />
Some say from pastry-cook it came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some from Cat and Fiddle.</span><br />
<br />
From no trim beaus its name it boasts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grey statesmen or green wits,</span><br />
But from this pell-mell pack of toasts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of old Cats and young Kits.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the year 1703, which was the second year of</p>

<p class="center"><i>Queen Anne</i>,</p>

<p>the famous Methuen treaty was formed; war between
England and France again driving us to Portuguese
vintages. And thus was cancelled one of the effects of
the Peace of Ryswick, which allowed the reopening of
trade with France. It was during this short open-trade
period that Farquhar produced his aptly named tragedy,
<i>Love and a Bottle</i>. In this comedy we are for the first
time introduced to champagne as a <i>vin mousseux</i>, or
sparkling wine. In act ii. scene 2, the lodgings of
Mockmode, a country squire, are represented; he is
conversing with his landlady, Widow Bullfinch:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mock.</i> But what&rsquo;s most modish for beverage now? For I
suppose the fashion of that always alters with the clothes.</p>

<p><i>Bullf.</i> The tailors are the best judges of that; but Champaign,
I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mock.</i> Is Champaign a tailor? Methinks it were a fitter name
for a wig-maker. I think they call my wig a campaign.</p>

<p><i>Bullf.</i> You&rsquo;re clear out, sir&mdash;clear out. Champaign is a fine
liquor, which all great beaux drink to make &lsquo;em witty.</p>

<p><i>Mock.</i> Witty! Oh, by the universe, I must be witty! I&rsquo;ll
drink nothing else; I never was witty in my life. Here, Club,
bring us a bottle of what d&rsquo;ye call it&mdash;the witty liquor.</p></div>

<p>The widow having retired, Club, Mockmode&rsquo;s servant,
re-enters with a bottle and glasses.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mock.</i> Is that the witty liquor? Come, fill the glasses....
But where&rsquo;s the wit now, Club? Have you found it?</p>

<p><i>Club.</i> Egad, master, I think &lsquo;tis a very good jest.</p>

<p><i>Mock.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Club.</i> Why, drinking, you&rsquo;ll find, master, that this same gentleman
in the <i>straw doublet</i>, the same will o&rsquo; the wisp, is a wit at the
bottom. Here, here, master, how it <i>puns and quibbles in the
glass</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mock.</i> By the universe, now I have it; the wit lies in the
jingling. Hear how the glasses rhyme to one another.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p></div>

<p>Evident allusion is here to the effervescence of champagne.</p>

<p>In his <i>Constant Couple</i>, we have:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Malice ne&rsquo;er spoke in generous Champaign.<br />
</p>

<p>But champagne, we have said, suffered like other
French wines from the War of Succession and the
Methuen treaty. By this treaty we were bound to
receive Portuguese wines in exchange for our woollen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>goods, and to deduct from the duty on importation one-third
of the rate levied on French wines. The new
demand led to an extension of Portuguese vineyards.
The demand continued to increase; the supply was
forthcoming, but too often with an article grossly mixed
and adulterated. Counterfeits poured into this country,
especially from Guernsey, and home manufactures of
spurious wine abounded. Mr. Cyrus Redding, an acknowledged
authority, in his treatise on French wines,
inveighs against what he considers the short-sighted
policy of our ministers in this reign. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We have only done now what wiser heads offered us nearly 150
years ago. M. de Torcy, in vain, proposed an open trade, the
advantages of which (now obvious enough to every man of common
sense) were scouted by the Government here, and the proposition
opposed, not only by the Parliament, but by that suffrage satirically
denominated, if not profanely, the <i>vox populi, vox Dei</i>. It was
almost an axiom in the last century, in relation to trade, that the
success or ruin of our commerce continually inclined for or against
us, as the trade of France with England was shut or open. Well
and justly did the late Lord Liverpool remark that the trade of
England had flourished in spite of our legislation. When France proposed,
in 1713-14, that a tariff should be made in England similar to
that of France and England in 1664, Lord Bolingbroke treated the
proposal with disdain. This tariff was simply that the duties and prohibitions
in both countries should be reciprocal. The duty to be paid
on both sides was five per cent. After so much of two centuries
has elapsed since, we can hardly do otherwise than admit that our
ideas of the true principles of trade continued to be erroneous too
long, that the offer of de Torcy was a just offer, and that any can
still be found obtuse enough to deny this fact shows that there
must be exceptions even to the common run of vulgar intellect.</p></div>

<p>Of the manners of the time we have abundant
sources of information. An interesting description is
given by Grose of the little country squire of about
300<i>l.</i> a year in Queen Anne&rsquo;s days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He never played at cards but at Christmas, when a family pack
wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>s produced from the mantel-piece. His chief drink, the year
round, was generally ale, except at this season, the fifth of November,
or some other gala days, when he would make a bowl of strong
brandy-punch, garnished with a toast and nutmeg.... In the
corner of his hall, by the fireside, stood a large wooden two-armed
chair with a cushion, and within the chimney corner were a couple
of seats. Here at Christmas he entertained his tenants, assembled
round a glowing fire.... In the meantime the jorum of ale was
in continual circulation.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p></div>

<p>But Christmas was not what it had been. It
struggled, almost in vain, to overcome the check it had
sustained during the Commonwealth. Private hospitality
and festivities were recovering, but the pageants
and masks in the royal household and at the Inns of
Court had received a death-blow. At the close of the
century, a revel, which would once have been regarded
as routine, was thought worthy to be recorded in a diary.
Evelyn notes a riotous Christmas at the Inner Temple
as late as 1697.</p>

<p>Such a falling off formed a common lament of the
poets:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Gone are those golden days of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Christmas was a high day;</span><br />

</p>

<p>Perhaps the most sensible festivities of this period
were certain annual feasts in London for natives of the
several counties. The <i>London Gazette</i>, for May 30 to
June 3, 1700, advertises &lsquo;the annual feast for gentlemen
of the county of Huntingdon.&rsquo; Another number
announces &lsquo;the anniversary feast for the gentlemen,
natives of the county of Kent.&rsquo; On such occasions,
bygone times would be recounted, mutual friends discussed,
and the absent not forgotten in a <i>toast</i>.</p>

<p>Burton ale was celebrated at least as early as 1712.
So remarks a writer who had probably found in the
<i>Spectator</i>, No. 383, the remark:&mdash;&lsquo;We concluded our
walk with a glass of Burton ale, and a slice of hung
beef.&rsquo; Had he forgotten that the author of <i>Ivanhoe</i>
carries back the fame of Burton ale to a date before the
time of Richard I.? And the accuracy of Sir Walter is
remarkable, for, in 1295, Matilda, daughter of Nicholas
de Shobenhale, &lsquo;released to the Abbot and Convent of
Burton-on-Trent that service and custody of their abbey
gate, together with the custody and annual rent thereto
belonging, and all the tenements within and without the
town of Burton which came to her by inheritance from
Walter de Scobenhale.... For which release they
granted her daily for life two white loaves from the
monastery, two gallons of conventual beer, or cider, if
they drank it, and one penny; also seven gallons of beer
for the men,&rsquo; &amp;c. These ales were brewed on the abbey
premises, where probably the abbots had their own
maltings: as it was a common covenant in leases of
mills, where were abbey property, for the malt of the
lords of the manor to be ground free.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>It is truly sad to contemplate the stream of talent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
which was polluted at this time by unrestrained indulgence
in strong drink. The infernal compounds which
were substituted for the light wines of a previous age
played infinite havoc, not only with the Mohocks of
aristocracy, but with the giants of intellect. Of the
Court itself, Macaulay writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All places where he could have his three courses and his three
bottles were alike to Prince George of Denmark, the husband of
Queen Anne.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p></div>

<p>Of Harley, Earl of Oxford, who was successively
Speaker of the House of Commons, Secretary of State,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord High Treasurer,
and who will always be remembered as the collector of
the Harleian Manuscripts, the same author, Macaulay,
writes, that he was in the habit of &lsquo;flustering himself
daily with claret, which was hardly considered as a fault
by his contemporaries.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Among the reasons given by the queen to the cabinet
for dismissing her Lord Treasurer, she alleges that he
neglected all business, was seldom to be understood;
that when he did explain himself, she could not depend
upon the truth of what he said; that he never came to
her at the time she appointed: that he often came
drunk.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Notorious as a drunkard in high places was Lord
Mohun, who was twice tried for committing murder
whilst in a state of intoxication. The duel between this
lord and the Duke of Hamilton&mdash;the wives of whom
were sisters at variance&mdash;is spoken of as probably the
last of the kind where the seconds were expected to engage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>as well as the principals, and fight to the death.</p>

<p>There is a wide discrepancy between the writings
and the reputed actions of Joseph Addison. He was
fond of wine, and indulged in it. His contemporary,
Swift, acknowledges the weakness. Dr. Johnson does
not conceal it. Macaulay laments the fact, Thackeray
glories in it.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> His biographer, Miss Aikin, is almost
singular in trying to defend him from the imputation.
She refers to the tone and temper, the correctness of
taste and judgment, of his writings in proof of his
sobriety, and doubts whether a man stained with the
vice of intoxication would have dared to write the essay
on drunkenness in the <i>Spectator</i> [No. 569]. But the
facts leave no room for doubt. He was from his youth
a great man for toasts. Verses are extant, in honour of
King William, from which we learn that it was his
custom to toast that king in bumpers of wine. In a
letter written at the age of 31 (1703), &lsquo;to Mr. Wyche,
his Majesty&rsquo;s Resident at Hambourg,&rsquo; he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My hand, at present, begins to grow steady enough for a letter,
so the properest use I can put it to is to thank ye honest gentleman
that set it a-shaking.... As your company made our stay at
Hambourg agreeable, your wine has given us all ye satisfaction
that we have found in our journey through Westphalia. If drinking
your health will do you any good, we may expect to be as long-lived
as Methusaleh&mdash;or, to use a more familiar instance, as ye
hoc in ye cellar.</p></div>

<p>So much from himself. Dr. Johnson remarks of
him:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>He studied all morning; then dined at a tavern; and went
afterwards to Button&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Button had been a servant in the Countess of Warwick&rsquo;s family,
who, under the patronage of Addison, kept a coffee-house on the
south side of Russell Street, about two doors from Covent Garden.
Here it was that the wits of that time used to assemble. It is said
when Addison had suffered any vexation from the countess, he
withdrew the company from Button&rsquo;s house. From the coffee-house
he went again to a tavern, where he often sat late, and drank
too much wine. In the bottle discontent seeks for comfort, cowardice
for courage, and bashfulness for confidence. It is not unlikely that
Addison was first seduced to excess by the manumission which he
obtained from the servile timidity of his sober hours. He that
feels oppression from the presence of those to whom he knows
himself superior, will desire to set loose his powers of conversation;
and who that ever asked succours from Bacchus was able to preserve
himself from being enslaved by his auxiliary?</p></div>

<p>And yet this was the man who could declare that
&lsquo;temperance and abstinence, faith and devotion, are in
themselves, perhaps, as laudable as any other virtues.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
His essay on Drunkenness, in the <i>Spectator</i>, might well
have proceeded from the pen of Hall or Taylor, Decker
or Wither. He exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A drunken man is a greater monster than any that is to be
found among all the creatures which God has made: as indeed
there is no character which appears more despicable and deformed,
in the eyes of all reasonable persons, than that of a drunkard....
This vice has very fatal effects on the mind, the body, and fortune
of the person who is devoted to it. In regard to the mind, it first
of all discovers every flaw in it. The sober man, by the strength
of reason, may keep under and subdue every vice or folly to which
he is most inclined; but wine makes every latent seed sprout up
in the soul, and shew itself; it gives fury to the passions, and force
to those objects which are apt to produce them. Wine heightens
indifference into love, love into jealousy, and jealousy into madness.
It often turns the good-natured man into an idiot, and the choleric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>into an assassin. It gives bitterness to resentment, it makes vanity
insupportable, and displays every little spot of the soul in its
utmost deformity.</p></div>

<p>And more to the same effect. But a passage of his,
to be found elsewhere, is far more terribly telling:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Death, the King of Terrors, was determined to choose a Prime
Minister; and his pale courtiers, the ghastly train of diseases, were
all summoned to attend, when each preferred his claim to the
honour of this illustrious office. Fever urged the numbers he had
destroyed; Cold Palsy set forth his pretensions by shaking all his
limbs; Gout hobbled up and alleged his great power of racking
every joint; and Asthma&rsquo;s inability to speak was a strong though
silent argument in favor of his claim; Stone and Colic pleaded
their violence; Plague his rapid progress in destruction; and Consumption,
though slow, insisted that he was sure. In the midst of
this contention the court was disturbed with the noise of music,
dancing, feasting, and revelry: when immediately entered a lady,
with a bold lascivious air and flushed countenance. She was
attended, on the one hand, by a troop of bacchanals, and on the
other by a train of wanton youths and damsels who danced half
naked to the softest musical instruments. Her name was Intemperance.
She waved her hand, and thus addressed the crowd of
diseases:&mdash;&lsquo;Give way, ye sickly band of pretenders, nor dare to
vie with my superior merits in the service of this monarch; am
I not your Queen? Do ye not receive your power of shortening
human life almost wholly from me? Who then so fit as myself
for this important office?&rsquo; The grisly monarch grinned a smile
of approbation, placed her on his right hand, and she immediately
became his principal favourite and Prime Minister.</p></div>

<p>Addison did another good service in exposing, in the
Tatler,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Adulteration</i>.</p>

<p>He says (No. 131):&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is in this city a certain fraternity of chemical operators,
who work underground in holes, caverns, and dark retirements, to
conceal their mysteries from the eyes and observation of mankind.
These subterraneous philosophers are daily employed in the transmutation
of liquors, and, by the power of magical drugs and incantations,
raising under the streets of London the choicest products of
the hills and valleys of France. They can squeeze Bordeaux out
of the sloe, and draw Champagne from an apple. Virgil, in that
remarkable prophecy,</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva.<br />
Virg., Ecl. iv. 29.<br />
(The ripening grape shall hang on every thorn),<br />
</p>

<p>seems to have hinted at this art, which can turn a plantation of
northern hedges into a vineyard. These adepts are known among
one another by the name of <i>wine-brewers</i>; and, I am afraid, do
great injury, not only to her Majesty&rsquo;s customs, but to the bodies
of many of her good subjects.</p></div>

<p>But adulteration was no new expedient. In the
reign of Edward III., a law was enacted, imposing
penalties on adulterations, and directing that an essay
of all the wines imported should be made, at least twice
a year in every town.</p>

<p>In 1426, Sir John Rainewell, mayor, received information
that the Lombard merchants were guilty of malpractices
in the adulteration of wines; upon inquiry,
he ascertained that the charge was well founded, and
ordered that the noxious compound, to the quantity of
150 butts, should be thrown into the kennel.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, a similar enactment was
passed in the fifth year of Mary. Much dread is expressed
of adulteration of good wine, either with inferior
wines or water, the penalty on discovery being the loss of
their whole stock.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And besyde the samin sic wynes as are sould in commoun

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In the seventeenth century Sir William Hawkins
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Since the Spanish sacks have been common in our taverns,
which for conservation are mingled with the lime in the making,
our nation complains of calentures, stone, dropsy, and infinite
other distempers not heard of before this wine came into common
use.</p></div>

<p>Henderson observes that according to the Custom
House Books of Oporto, for the year 1812, 135 pipes
and 20 hogsheads of wine were shipped for Guernsey.
In the same year, there were landed at the London
Docks alone 2,545 pipes and 162 hogsheads from that
island, reported to be port wine.</p>

<p>The subject of adulteration is much too large to
attempt to do any justice thereto; it must suffice to
draw attention to one or two specimens. The authorities
shall be disinterested.</p>

<p>The following receipt for <i>Port</i> is from a wine guide:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Take of good cider 4 gallons; of the juice of red beet, 2 quarts;
logwood, 4 oz.; rhatany root brewed, &frac12; a pound; first infuse the
logwood and rhatany root in brandy and a gallon of cider for a
week; then strain off the liquor, and mix the other ingredients;
keep in a cask for a month, when it will be fit to bottle.</p></div>

<p>In the <i>Mechanics&rsquo; Magazine</i> is given the chemical
analysis of a bottle of cheap <i>Port</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Spirits of wine, 3 oz.; cider, 14 oz.; sugar, 1&frac12; oz.; alum,
2 scruples; tartaric acid, 1 scruple; strong decoction of logwood,
4 oz.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Cyrus Redding, in his work on <i>Modern Wines</i>, lets
us into the secrets of cheap <i>Sherry</i>:&mdash;It &lsquo;is mingled
with Cape wine and cheap brandy, the washings of
brandy casks, sugar candy, bitter almonds, &amp;c. The
colour, if too great, is taken out by the addition of a
small quantity of lamb&rsquo;s blood; it is then passed off for
best sherry.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>Professor Mulder, in his <i>Chemistry of Wine</i>, tells
that during the process of wine-clearing such aids as
albumen, blood, cream, gypsum, marble, nutgalls, lime,
salt, gum-arabic, sulphuric acid, &amp;c., are furnished.</p>

<p>The scientific writer Dunovan, in his <i>Domestic
Economy</i>, makes us acquainted with a few of the drugs
with which beer is <i>doctored</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is absolutely frightful to contemplate the list of poisons and
drugs with which malt liquors have been (as it is technically and
descriptively called) <i>doctored</i>. Opium, henbane, cocculus indicus,
and Bohemian rosemary, which is said to produce a quick and
raving intoxication, supplied the place of alcohol; aloes, quassia,
gentian, sweet-scented flag, wormwood, horehound, and bitter
oranges, fulfilled the duties of hops; liquorice, treacle, and mucilage
of flax seed, stood for attenuated malt sugar. Capsicum, ginger,
and cinnamon, or rather cassia-buds, afforded to the exhausted
drink the pungency of carbonic acid. Burnt flour, sugar, or
treacle, communicated a peculiar taste, which porter-drinkers
generally fancy. Preparations of fish, assisted, in cases of obstinacy,
with oil of vitriol, procured transparency. Besides these, the
brewer had to supply himself with lime, potash, salt, and a variety
of other substances, which are of no other use, than in serving the
office of more valuable materials, and defrauding the customer.</p></div>

<p>But the subject is, like the frauds practised, without
a limit; references can only be subjoined.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The principal writer in the <i>Tatler</i>, that <i>censor
morum</i>, Richard Steele, was a prominent figure in the
convivial circle. Wine and extravagance were his bane.
He loved drink and was fond of acknowledging it. The
author of the <i>Christian Hero</i> wrote his devotional
treatise in drink and in debt. The arrival of a hamper
of wine could interrupt his moments of tenderest grief.
The emotions were forgotten as he sent for his friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>who join him in drinking &lsquo;two bottles apiece, with
great benefit to themselves, and not separating till two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A story told of him by Dr. Hoadley is characteristic
of the man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My father, when Bishop of Bangor, was, by invitation, present
at one of the Whig meetings, held at the Trumpet in Shoe Lane,
when Sir Richard, in his zeal, rather exposed himself, having the
double duty of the day upon him, as well to celebrate the immortal
memory of King William, it being the 4th November, as to drink
his friend Addison up to conversation pitch, whose phlegmatic
constitution was hardly warmed for society by that time. Steele
was not fit for it. Two remarkable circumstances happened.
John Sly, the hatter of facetious memory, was in the house; and
John, pretty mellow, took it into his head to come into the company
on his knees, with a tankard of ale in his hand to drink off to the
<i>immortal memory</i>, and to return in the same manner. Steele,
sitting next my father, whispered him&mdash;<i>Do laugh. It is humanity
to laugh.</i> Sir Richard, in the evening, being too much in the same
condition, was put into a chair, and sent home. Nothing would
serve him but being carried to the Bishop of Bangor&rsquo;s, late as it
was. However, the chairmen carried him home, and got him
upstairs, when his great complaisance would wait on them downstairs,
which he did, and then was got quietly to bed.</p></div>

<p>One of his own letters to Mrs. Scurlock reveals the
man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have been in very good company, where your health, under
the character of the woman I loved best, has been often drunk; so
that I may say that I am dead drunk for your sake, which is more
th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>an <i>I die for you</i>.</p></div>

<p>Matthew Prior, the poet, demands a notice. Whether
he was the son of a vintner or a joiner is a moot point.
He was certainly nephew to Samuel Prior, landlord of
the Rummer Tavern at Charing Cross, at which house,
in 1685, was held the annual feast of the nobility and
gentry living in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.
By this uncle he was brought up and sent to Westminster
School, after which he was employed, it is said,
at his uncle&rsquo;s as server. Taken up by Lord Dorset, his
career was remarkable, as author, as secretary to successive
embassies, as member of Parliament, as favourite of
the king. Dr. Johnson remarks that a survey of Prior&rsquo;s
life and writings may exemplify a sentence which he
doubtless understood well when he read Horace at his
uncle&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The vessel long retains the scent which it first receives.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld informs us, that having spent the
evening with Oxford, Bolingbroke, Pope, and Swift, he
would go to Long Acre and there drink a bottle of ale
with a common soldier and his wife. Thus does the dog
return to his vomit. Swift has left us a lively picture
of manners in his descriptive breakfast with my Lady
Smart at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Lord Smart, who was absent at the
levee, returns to dinner at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to receive the guests.
Seven of them dined, and were joined by a country
baronet, who had no appetite, having already eaten a
beefsteak and drunk two mugs of ale, besides a tankard
of March beer when he got up in the morning. They
drank claret, which the host said should always be drunk
after fish, and my Lord Smart particularly recommended
some cider to my Lord Sparkish. When the host called
for wine, he nodded to one or other of his guests, and
said, &lsquo;Tom Neverout, my service to you.&rsquo; After the
first course came pudding. Wine and small beer were
drunk during this second course.... After the puddings
came the third course.... Beer and wine were freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
imbibed during this course, the gentlemen always
pledging somebody with every glass which they drank....
After the goose, some of the gentlemen took a
dram of brandy. Dinner ended, Lord Smart bade
the butler bring up the great tankard full of October to
Sir John. The great tankard was passed from hand
to hand and mouth to mouth; but when pressed by the
noble host upon the gallant Tom Neverout, he said,
&lsquo;No faith, my lord, I like your wine, and won&rsquo;t put a
churl upon a gentleman. Your honour&rsquo;s claret is good
enough for me.&rsquo; The cloth removed, a bottle of Burgundy
was set down, of which the ladies were invited
to partake before they went to tea. When they left,
fresh bottles were brought, the &lsquo;dead men&rsquo;&mdash;meaning
the empty bottles&mdash;removed, and &lsquo;D&rsquo;you hear, John?
bring clean glasses,&rsquo; my Lord Smart said. On which
the Colonel said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my glass; for wine is the
best liquor to wash glasses in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was at this time that the works were published of
one who was at once the creature and exponent of the
times, Edward (better known as Ned) Ward. Campbell
observes that &lsquo;his works give a complete picture of the
mind of a vulgar but acute cockney. His sentiment is
the pleasure of eating and drinking.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Ward possessed
two qualifications for his depiction of manners; he was
a tavern-keeper, and a poet. At any rate his doggerel
secured him notice in the <i>Dunciad</i>. His <i>Secret History
of Clubs</i> is the authority for that kind of life at the
beginning of the eighteenth century. His <i>London Spy</i>
describes the coffee-houses of the day:&mdash;&lsquo;In we went
(says he), where a parcel of muddling muckworms were
as busy as so many rats in an old cheese-loft; some
going; some coming; some scribbling, some talking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
some drinking, some smoking, others jangling; and the
whole room stinking of tobacco, like a Dutch scoot or a
boatswain&rsquo;s cabin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Some of the famous taverns are also described in this
work, such as the &lsquo;Angel&rsquo; in Fenchurch Street, &lsquo;where the
vintner, like a double-dealing citizen, condescended as well
to draw carman&rsquo;s comfort, as the consolatory juice of the
vine.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Rose,&rsquo; in the Poultry, has gained a reputation:&mdash;&lsquo;There
in a snug room, warmed with brash and
faggot, over a quart of good claret, we laughed over our
night&rsquo;s adventure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Convivial life at the Universities may find its illustration
in the person of Bentley.</p>

<p>The following is told about Lord Cartaret and Bentley,
in Monk&rsquo;s <i>Life of Bentley</i>, vol. ii. p. 324 (2nd edit. 1833).</p>

<p>Lord Cartaret was a great scholar, and, being an old
Westminster boy, especially fond of Terence, which Dr.
Bentley had edited. Kippis relates this anecdote, in the
<i>Biographia Britannica</i>, vol. ii. p. 280:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dr. Bentley, when he came to town, was accustomed, in his
visits to Lord Cartaret, sometimes to spend the evenings with his
lordship. One day old Lady Granville reproached her son with
keeping the country clergyman, who was with him the night before,
till he was intoxicated. Lord Cartaret denied the charge; upon
which the lady replied that the clergyman could not have sung in
so ridiculous a manner unless he had been in liquor. The truth of
the case was, that the singing thus mistaken by her ladyship was
Dr. Bentley&rsquo;s endeavour to instruct and entertain his noble friend
by reciting Terence according to the true <i>cantilena</i> of the ancients.</p></div>

<p>Kippis, however, ought not to have called Lord Cartaret&rsquo;s
mother Lady Granville, as her son was the first
Lord Granville, to which title he was not yet appointed.
She was the Dowager Lady Cartaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Bentley himself &lsquo;is stated to have been an admirer
of good port wine, while he thought contemptuously of
claret, which, he said, &ldquo;would be port if it could.&rdquo;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>We infer also that Bentley did not despise ale. At
any rate a great quantity was drunk at the lodge of the
Master.</p>

<p>In 1710, when the Fellows appealed against Bentley
to the Visitor of Trinity, the Bishop of Ely, this was one
of the counts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Why have you for many years last past wasted the College
Bread, Ale, Beer, Coals, Wood, Turfe, Sedge, Charcoal, Linnen,
Pewter, Corn, Flower (<i>sic</i>), Brawn, and Bran, &amp;c.?<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In a single year&mdash;1708&mdash;the expense of ale and small beer was
no less at Trinity Lodge than 107<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p></div>

<p>The Fellows greatly protested against all this. And
Dr. King, an old opponent of Bentley&rsquo;s, made great stock
of the immense consumption of bread, beer, and fuel in
Bentley&rsquo;s lodge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He wrote a piece of humour, entitled &lsquo;Horace in Trinity College.&rsquo;
The fiction supposes Horace, in fulfilment of his well-known prophecy,
<i>Visam Britannos hospitibus feros</i>, to visit Britain and take
up his abode in the Master&rsquo;s lodge of Trinity College, where he gets
immensely fat (<i>Epicuri de grege porcus</i>) by the good cheer maintained
at the expense of the society.... Perhaps the most laughable
matter in the piece is the representation of a medal, bearing on
one side a figure of Horace, with a cup of audit ale in one hand,
some college rolls in the other, and an immeasurable rotundity of
person; and on the reverse <i>E Promptuar. Col. Trin. Cant.</i></p></div>

<p>What the excellent bishop describes as &lsquo;an immeasurable
rotundity of person&rsquo; seems to have been far from
uncommon in the Universities in these high days. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>read in a note in Monk&rsquo;s book, vol. ii. p. 394:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The portly appearance of the three esquire-beadles at that day
[about 1739] did much credit to university cheer. They are
described by Christopher Smart, in a copy of Latin verses, by the
following periphrasis:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;Pinguia tergeminorum abdomina Bedellorum.&rsquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>We have certainly in Pope&rsquo;s <i>Dunciad</i> also an allusion
to Bentley&rsquo;s love of port (book iv.) in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
As many quit the streams<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> that murmuring fall,<br />
To lull the sons of Margaret and Clare-hall,<br />
Where Bentley late tempestuous wont to sport<br />
In troubled waters, but now sleeps in port.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Pope always seemed to have disliked Bentley. But
these lines, and, still more, Pope&rsquo;s note, rather imply that
Bentley liked his port.</p>

<p>But everybody was not a <i>bon-vivant</i>. Many were in
the world, but not of it. What a contrast to the authors
quoted was John Philips, the author of <i>Cyder</i>, a Poem.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
And it is a poem worth reading. Johnson calls it a
Georgic after the manner of Virgil, nor does it suffer
from the comparison. The advice contained in it is
excellent. It praises use, it condemns abuse. It well
serves temperance. Thus in book ii., after praising
Nature for her annual gifts, which tend to the exhilaration
of languid minds, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Within</span><br />
The golden <i>Mean</i> confined: beyond, there&rsquo;s naught<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>Of health, or pleasure. Therefore, when thy Heart<br />
Dilates with fervent joys, and eager soul<br />
Prompts to persue the sparkling glass, be sure<br />
&lsquo;Tis time to shun it; if thou wilt prolong<br />
Dire compotation, forthwith Reason quits<br />
Her Empire to Confusion, and Misrule,<br />
And vain Debates; then twenty Tongues at once<br />
Conspire in senseless Jargon, naught is heard<br />
But din, and various clamour, and mad Rant:<br />
Distrust, and Jealousie to these succeed,<br />
And anger-kindling Taunt, the certain Bane<br />
Of well-knit Fellowship. Now horrid Frays<br />
Commence, the brimming glasses now are hurled<br />
With dire intent; Bottles with Bottles clash<br />
In rude Encounter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
Nor need we tell what anxious cares attend<br />
The turbulent Mirth of Wine; nor all the kinds<br />
Of Maladies, that lead to Death&rsquo;s grim cave,<br />
Wrought by Intemperance: joint-racking Gout,<br />
Intestine stone, and pining Atrophy,<br />
Chill, even when the sun with July Heats<br />
Frys the scorch&rsquo;d soil; and Dropsy all afloat,<br />
Yet craving Liquids.<br />
</p>

<p>When a poet could thus write, there is no wonder that
divines should have used still stronger language. John
Disney, in a powerful treatise,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> agitates for the execution
of the laws against immorality. His remarks on the
Sunday closing of public-houses are especially applicable
now:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If they must have refreshment, why cannot they have it at
their own houses? In truth refreshment is but a pretence for
excess and drunkenness. If company meets together in a public-house
on Sunday evening, when there is no danger of other business
that shall call them away, who shall tell them the critical min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ute
when they are sufficiently refreshed? Except the constable beat
up their quarters, they sit very contentedly hour after hour, and
call for pint after pint, and make themselves judges of their refreshment
till they&rsquo;re able to judge of nothing at all. If you still ask
what harm there is in going to a public-house for only an hour or
two, and to stay no longer, I might tell you that &lsquo;tis enough that
the Laws have forbidden it, and that her Majesty has reinforced
those laws.</p></div>

<p>Bishop Beveridge, who died in Anne&rsquo;s reign, wrote an
important sermon on &lsquo;The Duty of Temperance and
Sobriety.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is no sin but some have committed it in their drink; and
if there be any that a drunken man doth not commit, it is not
because he would not, but because he could not. He had not an
opportunity.... For a man in such a condition hath no sense of
the difference between good and evil; for &lsquo;wind,&rsquo; as the prophet
speaks (Hos. iv. 11), &lsquo;hath taken away his heart.&rsquo; His reason, his
understanding, his conscience, is gone; and therefore, all sins are
alike to him. Hence it is that their sin never goes alone, but hath
a great train of other sins always following it; insomuch that it
cannot so properly be called one single sin, as all sin is one.</p></div>

<p>The legislation of the reign was not important. The
1st Anne permitted tradesmen whose principal dealings
were in other goods to sell spirits by retail, without a
licence, provided they did not allow tippling in their
shops or houses.</p>

<p>Another law enacted in this reign allowed French
wines and other liquors to be imported in neutral bottoms.
Without this expedient it was believed that the
revenue would have been insufficient to maintain the
government.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">HANOVERIAN PERIOD.</p>


<p>A change of dynasty brought with it no amelioration
of manners. The fatal permission to set up distilleries,
which was granted after the Revolution of 1688, and
which was not withdrawn by William, was encouraged
by the Legislature in the reign of the first George. The
consequence was natural: distilleries multiplied, and drink
was sold so cheap that unrestrained indulgence prevailed.
The condition of things has been ably recorded by Mr.
Lecky.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> It was not till about 1724 that the passion for
gin-drinking infected the masses of the population, and
spread with the violence of an epidemic.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Small as is the place which this fact occupies in English
history, it was probably, if we consider all the consequences that
have flowed from it, the most momentous in that of the eighteenth
century&mdash;incomparably more so than any event in the purely
political or military annals of the country. The average of British
spirits distilled, which is said to have been only 527,000 gallons in
1684, had risen in 1727 to 3,601,000. Physicians declared that in
excessive gin-drinking a new and terrible source of mortality had
been opened for the poor. The grand jury of Middlesex declared
that much the greater part of the poverty, the murders, the robberies
of London, might be traced to this single cause. Retailers of gin
were accustomed to hang out painted boards announcing that their
customers could be made drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence,
and have straw for nothing; and cellars strewn with straw
were accordingly provided, into which those who had become
insensible were dragged, and where they remained till they had
sufficiently recovered to renew their orgies.</p></div>

<p>What preventive measures had soon to be taken, we
shall learn later on. But the home distilleries were not
the only bane. In consequence of the heavy duty to
which foreign spirits were subjected, the smuggling trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>began to be brisk. Rum, brandy, and hollands were
brought over from the Channel Islands in small barrels,
and were either landed at once or sunk in rafts to be
taken up when convenient. The smuggling trade threw
into the country immense quantities of spirits. Indeed
ale and beer were almost superseded by spirits and water,
or &lsquo;grog,&rsquo; as it then began to be called.</p>

<p>The origin of the term &lsquo;grog&rsquo; may interest, and is
as follows:&mdash;The British sailors had always been accustomed
to drink their allowance of brandy or rum clear,
till Admiral Vernon ordered those under his command
to mix it with water. The innovation gave offence to the
sailors, and for a time rendered the commander unpopular.
The admiral at that time wore a grogram coat, for which
reason they nicknamed him &lsquo;Old Grog&rsquo;&mdash;hence by degrees
the mixed liquor that he ordered obtained universally
the name of &lsquo;grog.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The brewing of <i>porter</i> began about the year 1722. It
is a drink which chiefly differs from beer by being made
with higher dried malt. It was then the common practice
in taverns to call for a pot of <i>half-and-half</i>, meaning
half ale and half twopenny, or sometimes an equal
portion of ale, beer, and twopenny, which was called
<i>three threads</i>. To avoid the trouble of drawing these
liquors from their respective casks, a person named
Harwood formed the plan of brewing a drink that would
at once yield the flavour of these combined ingredients.
He effected his object, calling the beverage &lsquo;entire,&rsquo; or
<i>entire butt</i>, because it was taken from one butt or vessel.
And inasmuch as it was purchased by porters and such
like persons, it became ever afterwards distinguished by
the name of <i>porter</i>.</p>

<p>The drink called <i>saloop</i> came into vogue at this time.
Reide&rsquo;s coffee-house, in Fleet Street, was one of t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>he first
houses in which it was sold. Called also <i>salep</i>, and
<i>salop</i>; it was a greasy-looking beverage, sold much on
stalls in the early morning. It was prepared from a
powder made of the root of the <i>Orchis mascula</i>, and from
the green-winged meadow orchis. Salep was long imported
from the Levant, till it was discovered that our
native plants could supply it, specially the early purple
orchis. It used, like porter, to be a favourite drink of
porters, coal-heavers, &amp;c. It is said to contain more
nutritious matter in proportion to its bulk than any
other known root: an ounce of salep was thought to be
support for a man for a day. It is still much used in
the East. In Hindoostanee it is called <i>salab-ee-misree</i>,
in Persian <i>sahleb</i>. In the present century it has been
superseded by coffee-barrows; but Charles Lamb has left
some account of this drinkable, which he says was of all
preparations the most grateful to the stomachs of young
chimney-sweeps.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Ales commonly became known by the name of the
<i>district</i> that produced them&mdash;e.g. <i>Dorset</i> beer, <i>Oxford</i>
ale. Thus, John Byrom writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>May 18, 1725.</i>&mdash;I found the effect of last night&rsquo;s drinking that
foolish <i>Dorset</i>, which was pleasant enough, but did not at all agree
with me, for it made me very stupid all day.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Oxford Ale</i> was the subject of a panegyric written by
Warton in 1720&mdash;and a panegyric from such a man
would be, in the opinion of many, a boon of immortality.</p>

<p>The drinking at this time has already been spoken of
as an epidemic. Wine was necessary on all occasions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>The <i>marriage</i> ceremony was incomplete without it, as is
abundantly evident from contemporary verse. More
than one ridiculed the notion so prevalent, that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Wine must seal the marriage-bands.</p></div>

<p>But the Church had long since sanctioned a belief in
its spell. The Sarum Missal had taught that the bridal
cup must be blessed by the priest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Post missam, panis et vinum, vel aliud bonum potabile, in
vasculo proferatur.</p></div>

<p>And so the hallowing of wine and sops was usual from
the court to the cottage.</p>

<p><i>Burials</i> were imperfect without the cup. M. Misson,
in his <i>Observations</i>, notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Butler, the keeper of the Crown and Sceptre Tavern in St.
Martin&rsquo;s Lane, told me that there was a tun of red port drunk at
his wife&rsquo;s burial, besides mulled white wine.&mdash;No men ever go to
women&rsquo;s burials, nor women to men&rsquo;s, so that there were none but
women at the drinking of Butler&rsquo;s wine. Such women in England
will hold it out with the men, when they have a bottle before them,
as well as upon the other occasion, and battle infinitely better than
they.</p></div>

<p>The number of <i>public-houses</i> was excessive. In 1725
a report from a committee of Middlesex magistrates
stated that at that period there were in the metropolis,
exclusive of the City of London and Southwark, 6,187
houses and shops wherein &lsquo;geneva, or other strong
waters,&rsquo; were sold by retail. The population was then
about 700,000. In some cases every seventh house was
employed in the sale of intoxicants.</p>

<p>We get a life-like picture of the times from Daniel
Defoe; and if it be objected that his writing is fiction,
we reply with Thackeray that the fiction carries a
greater amount of truth in solution than the volume
which purports to be all true. On the subject of dri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>nk
amongst <i>women</i>, and drink as a medicine, what can be
more touching than the following from his <i>Life of Colonel
Jack</i>?&mdash;</p>

<p>The hero, Colonel Jack, is giving an account of his
third wife:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I was infinitely satisfied with my wife, who was, indeed, the
best-humoured woman in the world, and a most accomplished
beautiful creature&mdash;indeed, perfectly well bred, and had not one ill
quality about her; and this happiness continued without the least
interruption for about six years. But I at last had a disappointment
of the worst sort even here. She caught cold, and grew very
sickly. In being so continually ill and out of order, she very unhappily
got a habit of drinking cordials and hot liquors.</p>

<p>Drink, like the devil, when it gets hold of any one, though but
a little, goes on by little and little to their destruction; so in my
wife, her stomach being weak and faint, she first took this cordial,
then that&mdash;till, in short, she could not live without them; and
from a drop to a sup, from a sup to a dram, from a dram to a glass,
and so on to two, till at last she took, in short, to what we call
drinking.</p>

<p>As I likened drink to the devil in its gradual possession of the
habits and person, so it is yet more like the devil in its encroachment
on us, where it gets hold of our senses. In short, my beautiful,
good-humoured, modest, well-bred wife, grew a beast, a slave
to strong liquor, and would be drunk at her own table, nay, in her
own closet by herself, till she lost her beauty, her shape, her
manners, and at last her virtue.</p>

<p>Oh! the power of intemperance! And how it encroaches on
the best disposition in the world; how it comes upon us gradually
and insensibly, and what dismal effects it works upon our morals,
changing the most virtuous, regular, well-instructed, and well-inclined
tempers into worse than brutal! Never was a woman
more virtuous, sober, modest, and chaste, than my wife. She never
so much as desired to drink anything strong. It was with the
greatest entreaty that I could prevail with her to drink a glass or
two of wine, and rarely, if ever, above one or two at a time; even
in company she had no inclination to it. Not an immodest word
ever came out of her mouth, nor would she suffer it in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>any one else
in her hearing without resentment.</p>

<p>But during her illness and weakness, her nurse pressed her,
whenever she found herself faint, and a sinking of her spirits, to
take this cordial, and that dram, till it became necessary to keep
her alive, and gradually increased to a habit, so that it was no
longer her physic but her food. Her appetite sunk and went quite
away, and she ate little or nothing, but she came at last to a dreadful
height, that, as I have said, she would be drunk in her dressing-room
before eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, in short, at last
was never sober.</p>

<p>Let any one judge of my case now; I, that for six years thought
myself the happiest man alive, was now the most miserable distracted
creature. As to my wife, I loved her well and pitied her
heartily. I almost locked her up, and set people over her to take
care of her; but her health was ruined, and in about a year and a
half she died.</p></div>

<p>Rightly did the poet Gay in his <i>Court of Death</i> make
Death give the palm to <i>intemperance</i> amongst the claimant
diseases:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Merit was ever modest known.<br />
What, no physician speak his right!<br />
None here! but fees their toil requite.<br />
Let then Intemperance take the wand,<br />
Who fills with gold their zealous hand:<br />
You, Fever, Gout, and all the rest&mdash;<br />
Whom wary men as foes detest&mdash;<br />
Forego your claims. No more pretend;<br />
Intemperance is esteemed a friend;<br />
He shares their mirth, their social joys,<br />
And as a courted guest destroys.<br />
The charge on him must justly fall,<br />
Who finds employment for you all.<br />
</p>

<p>Amongst the many who shortened their days through
excess, must be mentioned the name of Thomas Parnell.
Dr. Johnson, in his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, observes:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>Pope represents him as falling into intemperance of wine after
Queen Anne&rsquo;s death, in consequence of disappointed ambition.
That in his later life he was too much of a lover of the bottle is
not denied; but I have heard it imputed to a cause more likely to
obtain forgiveness from mankind, the untimely death of a darling
son; or, as others tell, the loss of his wife, who died 1712.</p></div>

<p>The latter is probably the true solution. He had married
a woman of great beauty, Miss Anne Minchin, who died
soon after that event, and grief probably preyed upon
his fitful spirits, and led him into intemperance. He
died before he was forty. Well for him had he imitated
the character drawn in his exquisite poem <i>The
Hermit</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The great vain man who fared on costly food,<br />
Whose life was too luxurious to be good;<br />
Who made his ivory stands with goblets shine,<br />
And forced his guests to morning draughts of wine;<br />
Has, with the cup, the graceless custom lost,<br />
And still he welcomes, but with less of cost.<br />
</p>

<p>The most advanced exponent of the conviviality of
the time was William Congreve, at one time commissioner
of wine licences. His comedies are steeped in
vice. Congreve&rsquo;s comic feast (says Thackeray) flares
with lights, and round the table, emptying their flaming
bowls of drink, and exchanging the wildest jests and
ribaldry, sit men and women, waited on by rascally
valets and attendants&mdash;perhaps the very worst company
in the world. To him (says the same author) the world
seemed to have no moral at all. His ghastly doctrine
seemed to be that we should eat, drink, and be merry
when we can, and go to the deuce (if there be one) when
the time comes!</p>

<p>The experience of the self-made Franklin is very
suggestive as to the drinking habits of working men in
London 160 years ago. For from the habits of printers
one may infer the habits of other craftsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>When the famous Dr. Franklin was a printer&rsquo;s boy
in England&mdash;he came to England in 1724 or 1725&mdash;he
found all his companions in the printing office drank
five pints of porter daily at their work, and one of them
even six. He was himself a water-drinker, but could
not get any of them to see his argument &lsquo;that bread
contained more materials of strength than beer, and
that it was only corn in the beer that produced the
strength in the liquid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, as it is quite clear that, if these printing
&lsquo;prentices drank five pints of porter at their work, they
would have extra drink out of work hours, we have in
this anecdote an appalling picture of the drinking in
England 160 years ago. What working man now
<i>averages</i> five pints per diem?<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>A useful little work was published in 1725, entitled
<i>The Publick-House-keeper&rsquo;s Monitor</i>. The author prefaces,
that the reigning vices of the age make it a duty to consider
and use any practicable methods to put a stop to
&lsquo;that deluge of Impiety which overflows almost this
whole nation.&rsquo; He complains that there are <i>too many</i> of
these houses which enjoy &lsquo;a legal allowance,&rsquo; that <i>many</i>
ought to be suppressed, but that it is persistently urged</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>that they are beneficial to the Publick; that they raise the
Revenues of the Crown, and must therefore be supported in Complaisance
to the Government. So far have Political Motives in
this, as well as many other cases, got the better of religious ones;
the Almighty must be serv&rsquo;d last, if at all: And too many of the
Substitutes of an Earthly Power, are apt to forget whose Vicegerent
he is, and consequently from whom originally they derive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Authority, which would discover to them to whom they principally
owe their Duty.</p>

<p>For indeed the same Argument, which prevails for the allowing
of so many publick Houses, must, and, I fear, too often does prevail
for the Neglect of a careful Inspection into the Management of
them, and for a Connivance at the many Irregularities committed
in them; &lsquo;twould be a Means of sinking the Publick Revenues, if
they were strictly confin&rsquo;d to the Observance of those Laws, which
were made for good Purposes. And what does all this amount to,
but that <i>Cæsar</i> must have his Due, with a <i>non obstante</i> that the
Almighty is defrauded?</p></div>

<p>He then proceeds to discuss the legitimate uses of
taverns:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The First Use of Publick-Houses is, to refresh hungry or weary
Travellers; to receive those, whose Time or Strength permits them
not to go farther, and to furnish them with such Lodging and Provision,
that being recruited, they may be the better able to proceed
in their Journey.</p></div>

<p>But such houses are too numerous:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Instead of their being too few, there are upon most Roads
abundantly too many Houses of Reception; so many, that they
not only destroy one another&rsquo;s lawful and honest Maintenance, but
lie like so many Snares in the way of Travellers. There are but
few Parts of this Kingdom, if any, where Market-Towns are not
near enough together, to serve all the Ends and Purposes of Publick
Houses; and I may say, there are but few, if any, Market-Towns,
which are not greatly over-stock&rsquo;d with them. However, as to the
Usefulness of them in general, let it suffice to observe, that where
they stand conveniently situated, and are wisely and honestly
manag&rsquo;d, they are undoubtedly a very great Advantage to a
Nation.</p></div>

<p>Another use, he tells us, is to receive and provide for
those who live in the same place and who are not housekeepers
themselves, but who, being sojourners, journeymen,
or servants, find it a great conveniency to repair to
such houses for their meals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>Then again they are useful (he urges) to receive
persons who meet together</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>upon making Contracts or Bargains in the Way of Commerce; and
whether this be done at common and ordinary Times, or at the
more publick and stated Seasons of Fairs and Markets; or lastly,
whether the publick Business of the Nation, or the more private
Affairs of Lordships, Parishes, &amp;c., do require the Meeting together
of many Persons; so that the most convenient Places for these are
generally esteemed such Houses as I am treating of. However,
this may be affirm&rsquo;d of them all in general, that the Design of
them is to be useful; and that their Usefulness consists in their
being duly and regularly kept, according to the several Laws of the
Nation, provided for that purpose, and founded upon the necessities
and Conveniences of the People.</p></div>

<p>He proceeds to lay down stated rules to be observed
by such persons as keep taverns. He urges upon them
first of all, personal sobriety, a strict regard to chastity,
a scrupulous regard to honesty, that every one have
goods, in quantity and quality, according to the value of
their money. He exposes fearlessly the injustice of the</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>high Rents, to which Publick-Houses are generally advanced, so as
very often to exceed double the Rents of private ones of the same
real Goodness. This tempts the Land-lords of Houses to let them
for that Purpose; and this tempts, and, as they will probably urge,
obliges the Tenants, by some Means or other, to make more than
ordinary Gains upon their Guests; but surely neither of them
consider what they are about; how they jointly conspire to carry
on a Trade of Iniquity, and are Partakers of each other&rsquo;s Sins. He
that lets his House for a publick one, only because he can thereby
advance his Rent, is not aware how deeply he is concern&rsquo;d in all
the Wickedness that is consequent thereupon; and he who gives
above the just Value of an House upon the same Account, does not
regard how many Tricks and Frauds, what Impositions and Extortions,
what Allowance of Wickedness and Debauchery, what a
continued Scene of Iniquity, in short, he will be tempted to go
through, in Order to discharge so heavy a burthen of expences, and
yet to maintain himself and his family.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>Secondly, he urges that the landlord should avoid
and decline every thing that may encourage intemperance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The World is indeed sufficiently inclin&rsquo;d to Sensuality of all
Sorts, and Multitudes do frequent Publick-Houses, especially with a
previous Purpose and Design of committing Excess. But even
those, who design it not, are often betray&rsquo;d into it by the Arts and
Contrivances of them, who are to be Gainers by it, by drawing
them on from one Quantity to another, by helping &lsquo;em to Companions
that will set forward Intemperance, or by doing it themselves;
but especially by giving Credit to those of the meaner Sort,
who must otherwise be sober upon Necessity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tis surprizing to observe, what Scores a Sot shall be allow&rsquo;d to
contract at some Houses for Liquor, who would not be trusted for
half the Sum by any of his Neighbours, to provide Bread for his
Family; one, who thus reduces them to a Necessity of begging,
stealing, or perishing, whilst he riotously consumes what might
preserve them from all; but this he finds Means to do, through the
Encouragement of those who have so little love for their neighbours
that they care not how many families they starve to support their
own.</p></div>

<p>The little book is thoroughly worthy to be reprinted.
Would that every one engaged in &lsquo;the trade&rsquo; would lay
its maxims to heart!</p>

<p>About this time was published a guide-book, under
the title of <i>Vade-mecum of Malt-worms</i>, containing a list
of all the ale-houses in London, &amp;c. Some of these, says
Wright, in his <i>Caricature History of the Georges</i>, under
the name of <i>mug-houses</i>, became the resort of small
societies or clubs of political partisans. Some of these
were the scenes of terrible party turbulence.</p>

<p>But we cannot leave the first Hanoverian reign without
noticing another treatise much needed&mdash;quite as much&mdash;viz.
that of Dr. Peter Browne, Bishop of Cork, who in
1716 wrote <i>A Discourse of Drinking Healths</i>.</p>

<p>By this time the abuse of the practice of <i>toasting</i> had
become a national disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>The way in which anything or anybody that one
drank a health to, came to be called a <i>toast</i> has baffled
derivation hunters of all degrees, and we are no wiser
to-day than we were in 1709, when Isaac Bickerstaffe,
in the twenty-fourth number of the newly-established
<i>Tatler</i>, attempted to settle the matter by saying how, at
Bath, in the time of Charles II., a celebrated beauty
happened to be in the Cross-Bath, and out of the crowd
of her admirers who were in the room, one of them took
from her bath a cup of the water in which the lady
was standing and drank her health to the company.
Another of her admirers who was present, being half intoxicated,
instead of pledging or drinking in response to
the sentiment, announced his attention of jumping into
the water and carrying off the bather, swearing that
though he liked not the liquor, yet he would have <i>the
toast</i>. He was opposed in his resolution, yet this whim
gave foundation to the present honour which is due to
the lady we mention in our liquor, who has ever since
been called a toast. It is far more likely that, as Ellis
observes, the use of the word on this occasion was a <i>consequence</i>
of its previous employment for a like purpose,
and not the cause of its being adopted. It is probable
that <i>toast</i> came to be used in the sense it is stated to
have been by the bath gallant, gradually, at first meaning
a mere material relish or improvement to a glass
of liquor, and afterwards getting to be applied to the
&lsquo;sentimental relish,&rsquo; or, as Sheridan truly calls it, the
&lsquo;excuse for the glass.&rsquo; Toasted bread formed a favourite
addition to English drinks so early as the sixteenth
century, and in the cups of sack and punch, brown
toasts frequently floated at the top. In Wyther&rsquo;s
<i>Abuses Stript and Whipt</i> (published 1618) mention is
made, as has been already noticed, of a draught &lsquo;that
must be spiced with a nut-browne tost.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Hall states that there were some who drank healths
upon their knees; some put their own blood into
their drink and then drank a health to the king. So
that the young Hectors not only cultivated habits of
barbarity, but also linked themselves with blasphemy.
But there was one other way of drinking healths still
to be told, a piece of unparalleled tomfoolery&mdash;that of
toasting a lady in some nauseous decoction. When this
fashion was popular, two students at Oxford were each
enamoured of the reigning belle of that sober University,
and, as a test of the relative depth of their devotion, they
applied themselves to toasting her in the manner we have
mentioned. One, determined to prove that his love did
not stick at trifles, took a spoonful of soot, mixed it with
his wine, and drank off the mixture. His companion,
determined not to be outdone, brought from his closet a
phial of ink, which he drank, exclaiming, &lsquo;Io triumphe
and Miss Molly.&rsquo; These crackbrained young men also
esteemed it a great privilege to get possession of any
great beauty&rsquo;s shoe, in order that they might ladle wine
out of a bowl down their throats with it, the while they
drank to the &lsquo;lady of little worth&rsquo; or the &lsquo;light-heeled
mistress&rsquo; who had been its former wearer.</p>

<p>Is there any wonder that Dr. Peter Browne spoke
out? He strongly condemned the practice on theological,
moral, and common-sense grounds, of opinion
that it had its origin in Pagan usages, though he is
vague as to the particular custom out of which it arose.
He classifies the various acceptations of a <i>health</i> under
six heads:&mdash;(1) When a curse or imprecation is intended
upon the person drinking, or (2) upon any other
person; (3) when one drinks in honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> remembrance
of absent living friends; or (4) by way of
wishing others health and prosperity; or (5) in token
of our respect and good-will to another, or approbation
of any affair; and (6) as an outward indication of our
loyalty. All such health-drinking, the learned prelate
urges, is incompatible with the duty of good Christians,
whom he exhorts to suppress the practice. He also cites
an interesting formula used by the Jews in drinking,
which is the first instance, to my knowledge, of a curse
being intended instead of an expression of good-will; the
words, upon the authority of Buxtorf, meaning, in their
ordinary signification, &lsquo;much good may it do you;&rsquo; but
the utterer thereof, by a kind of mental reservation or
adaptation, implied a curse&mdash;nay, as many curses as the
letters stand for, viz. 165.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>From incidental notices we discover how very exceptional
was the absence of toasts. Thus, in a description
of home life at Badminton, we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the gentlemen chose a glass of wine the civil offers were made
to go down into the vaults, which were very large and sumptuous,
or servants, at a sign given, attended with salvers, &amp;c., and many a
brisk went round about; but no sitting at table with tobacco and
healths, as the common use is.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>But the full extent of the unbridled excess of the
period can best be estimated from a survey of the legislative
enactments of the reign of the second George.
They are worthy of careful consideration.</p>

<p>In the second year of this reign such a duty was
placed upon spirits as to be nearly tantamount to a prohibition
of their retail sale. A duty of 20<i>l.</i> was imposed
on the spirit retail licence, which for the first time was
ordered to be renewed annually. Moreover, dealers
in spirits were placed under the same regulations as
<i>Publicans</i>, in respect to Licences. This Act, after reciting
the inconveniences arising from persons being
licensed to keep inns and common ale-houses by justices
living at a distance, who were not truly informed as to
the need of such inns, or the character of the persons
licensed, provides that no licence to keep an inn, ale-house,
or victualling-house, or to retail strong waters,
should be granted, but at a general meeting of justices of
the division. This Act failed to answer the purpose of
its promoters. Hawkers went about the streets selling
coloured spirits under feigned names; so in the sixth
year of the same reign the Act was repealed, and in its
place an Act was passed (1732) which imposed a penalty
of 10<i>l.</i> upon the retail sale of spirits, except sold in
dwelling-houses. By this masterpiece of wisdom (!) every
householder was potentially converted into a publican;
nor did they fail to avail themselves of the perm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ission.
Intemperance spread like a plague.</p>

<p>When matters had reached a pitch absolutely intolerable,
a petition was presented to Parliament (Feb. 20,
1736) from the magistrates of Middlesex assembled at
quarter sessions. In this petition it was stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That the drinking of Geneva, and other distilled liquors, had
for some years past greatly increased:</p>

<p>That the constant and excessive use thereof had destroyed
thousands of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects:</p>

<p>That great numbers of others were by its use rendered unfit for
useful labor, debauched in morals, and drawn into all manner of
vice and wickedness:</p>

<p>That those pernicious liquors were not only sold by distillers
and geneva shop-keepers, but by many persons in inferior trades,
by which means journeymen apprentices and servants were drawn
in to taste and by degrees to like, approve, and immoderately to
drink thereof:</p>

<p>That the public welfare and safety, as well as the trade of the
nation, would be greatly affected by it:</p>

<p>That the practice was dangerous to the health, strength, peace,
and morals; and tended greatly to diminish the labour and industry
of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p></div>

<p>Upon the petition being referred to a committee of
the entire House, it was resolved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That the <i>low price</i> of spirituous liquors is the principal inducement
to the excessive and pernicious use thereof.</p>

<p>That in order to prevent this excessive and pernicious use, a
discouragement be given thereto by a duty to be laid on spirits
sold by retail.</p>

<p>That the selling of such liquors be <i>restrained</i> to persons keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>public brandy-shops, victualling-houses, coffee-houses, ale-houses,
innholders, <i>and to such Surgeons and Apothecaries as shall make
use of it by way of medicine only</i>.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></div>

<p>The Government were at last in earnest: a bill was
introduced, the intention of which was to strike a fatal
blow, to annihilate the gin traffic. But the blow was
too sudden. A rebound was almost inevitable. The
Gin Act, which has rendered the year 1736 famous in the
annals of history, was introduced into and carried through
Parliament by Sir Joseph Jekyll. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas the excessive drinking of spirituous liquors by the
common people tends not only to the destruction of their health
and the debauching of their morals, but to the public ruin:</p>

<p>For remedy thereof&mdash;</p>

<p>Be it enacted, that from September 29th no person shall
presume, by themselves or any others employed by them, to sell or
retail any brandy, rum, arrack, usquebaugh, geneva, aqua vitæ, or
any other distilled spirituous liquors, mixed or unmixed, in any less
quantity than two gallons, without first taking out a licence for
that purpose within ten days at least before they sell or retail the
same; for which they shall pay down 50<i>l.</i>, to be renewed ten days
before the year expires, paying the like sum, and in case of neglect
to forfeit 100<i>l.</i>, such licenses to be taken out within the limits of
the penny post at the chief office of Excise, London, and at the
next office of Excise for the country. And be it enacted that for all
such spirituous liquors as any retailers shall be possessed of on or
after September 29th, 1736, there shall be paid a duty of 20<i>s.</i> per
gallon, and so in proportion for a greater or lesser quantity above
all other duties charged on the same.</p>

<p>The collecting the rates by this Act imposed to be under the
management of the commissioners and officers of Excise by all the
Excise laws now in force (except otherwise provided by this Act),
and all moneys arising by the said duties or licenses for sale thereof
shall be paid into the receipt of his Majesty&rsquo;s Exchequer distinctly
from other branches of the public revenue; one moiety of the fines,
penalties, and forfeitures to be paid to his Majesty and successors,
the other to the person who shall inform on any one for the same.</p></div>

<p>The Act was virtually prohibitive. But the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>were too far gone to bear it. It was ineffectual to check
even the progress of intemperance. The vices of the
populace rendered them desperate. The Act, says Dr.
Lees, produced vast excitement.</p>

<p>The populace of London, Bristol, Norwich, and other
towns, honoured what they called the &lsquo;death of Madame
Gin&rsquo; with formal &lsquo;funeral&rsquo; processions, whereat many
of her devoted admirers, male and female, got &lsquo;gloriously
drunk.&rsquo; The distillers took out <i>wine</i> licences, offered
gin&mdash;spiced and wined&mdash;for sale, under a new name;
while <i>drams</i> were sold in the brandy-shops, under the
quaint appellations of &lsquo;Sangree,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tom Row,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cuckold&rsquo;s
Comfort,&rsquo; &lsquo;Parliament Gin,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Last Shift,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo;
Delight,&rsquo; &lsquo;King Theodore of Corsica,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cholic-and-Gripe-Waters,&rsquo;
&amp;c. Lord Cholmondeley said, on the part of the
Government, that the law exposed them to <i>rebellion</i>, and
that they had information of its being designed; but by
parading the troops in the dangerous locality, they had
probably prevented riot and bloodshed. In March 1738
a proclamation was passed to enforce the Act and to
protect the efforts of the officers of justice.</p>

<p>The consumption of spirits in England and Wales
rose from 13,500,000 gallons in 1734, to 19,000,000 in
1742, and there were within the bills of mortality more
than 20,000 houses and shops in which gin was sold by
retail. As might be expected, <i>informers</i> became objects
of popular hatred, and were hunted through the streets.
Of course, the more respectable traffickers abandoned
the proscribed business, which fell into the hands of
reckless and disreputable men, who set at nought the
provisions of the law. &lsquo;Within two years of the passing
of the Act,&rsquo; says the historian, though 12,000 persons
had been convicted of offences against it, &lsquo;it had become
odious and contemptible;&rsquo; and policy, as well as humanity,
forced the commissioners of excise to mitigate its penalties.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>The House of Lords soon rang with impetuous
debate; and the Act was doomed to modification. In
1743, the Lords read a Bill for repealing certain Duties
on Spirituous Liquors and on Licences for retailing the
same. In the debate, Lord Hervey remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As it is the quality of this malignant liquor to corrupt the mind,
it likewise destroys the body.... Drunkenness not only corrupts
men by taking away those restraints by which they are withheld
from the perpetration of villanies, but by superadding the temptations
of poverty&mdash;temptations not easily resisted even by those
whose eyes are open to the consequences of their actions, but which
will <i>certainly</i> prevail over those whose apprehensions are laid
asleep, and who never extend their views beyond the gratification
of the present moment.... Instead, therefore, of promoting a
practice <i>so evidently detrimental</i> to society, let us oppose it with
the most vigorous efforts; let us begin our opposition by opposing
this bill, and then consider whether the execution of the former
law shall be enforced, <i>or whether another more efficacious can be
formed</i>.... No man, unacquainted with the motives by which
senatorial debates are too often influenced, would suspect that after
the pernicious qualities of this liquor, and the general inclination
among the people to the immoderate use of it, it could be afterwards
enquired, <i>Whether this universal thirst for poison ought to
be encouraged by the legislature?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lonsdale</span> said&mdash;In every part of this great metropolis,
whoever shall pass along the streets, will find wretchedness
stretched upon the pavement, insensible and motionless, and only
removed by the charity of passengers from the danger of being
crushed by carriages or trampled by horses, or strangled with filth
in the common sewers; and others, <i>less helpless perhaps, but more
dangerous, who have drunk too much to fear punishment, but not
enough to hinder them from provoking it</i>.... No man can pass
a single hour in public places without meeting such objects, or
hearing such expressions as disgrace human nature,&mdash;such as cannot
be looked upon without horror, or heard without indignation, <i>and
which there is no possibility of removing or preventing</i>, <span class="smcap">whilst this hateful liquor is publicly</span> SOLD.... These liquors not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
only infatuate the mind, but poison the body; they not only fill
our streets with madmen and our prisons with criminals, but our
hospitals with cripples.... Nor does the use of spirits, my lords,
only impoverish the public by lessening the number of useful and
laborious hands, but by cutting off those recruits by which its
natural and inevitable losses are to be supplied. The use of distilled
liquors impairs the fecundity of the human race, and hinders
that increase which Providence has ordained for the support of the
world. Those women who riot in this poisonous debauchery are
quickly disabled from bearing children, or, what is still more
destructive to general happiness, produce children diseased from
their birth, and who, therefore, are an additional burden, and must
be supported through a miserable life by that labour which they
cannot share, and must be protected by that community of which
they cannot contribute to the defence.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding volleys of violent opposition, especially
from the Bishops, the Bill was carried: sixty per
cent. of the House voting in its favour. The law was
again relaxed. Parliament was overwhelmed with petitions
which were the expression of a disappointed philanthropy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The petitions of the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London,
state, &lsquo;that the common and habitual use of spirituous liquors by
the lower ranks of people, prevails to such a degree, that <i>it destroys
the health, strength, and industry of the poor of both sexes and
all ages, inflames them with rage and barbarity, and occasions
frequent robberies and murders in the streets of the Metropolis</i>.&rsquo;
The petition from the Minister and Churchwardens of St. Martin&rsquo;s,
Westminster, recites that in consequence of the low price of
spirits, their use has become excessive&mdash;&lsquo;the substance of the
people is wasted&mdash;idleness and disorder have taken the place of
industry&mdash;and robberies and murders are committed under their
influence.&rsquo; The petition from Bristol states, &lsquo;that the bad effects
of spirituous liquors have become apparent in the destruction of
the habits of the people&mdash;corrupting their morals, and rendering
them incapable of manly employments&rsquo;&mdash;reducing them to poverty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span><i>and hardening them to the commission of crimes of the utmost
enormity</i>. That of the Merchants adds&mdash;&lsquo;commerce was injured.&rsquo;
These crowds of petitions almost universally affirm that the <i>great
increase in the number of Gin-shops, and the low price of the
article</i>, were the causes of its excessive use <i>amongst the lower
orders</i>.</p>

<p>On these representations, the House again resolved &lsquo;That it
was necessary to regulate the sale of spirits by retail.&rsquo; Measures
were adopted for the <i>suppression of smuggling</i>, and the celebrated
Tippling Act was passed.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p></div>

<p>By this Act, no persons could recover for the price
of spirits sold in less quantities than 20<i>s.</i> at one time.</p>

<p>But just in proportion as spirits were rendered legally
inaccessible, appetite was diverted into the channel of
beer. The rent was made possibly worse. Hitherto it
had been necessary to impose restrictions upon the article
sold; now the vendor must furnish guarantees. The
26th of the same George, after declaring former laws to
be defective and insufficient, required the justices, when
they granted licences, to take the recognisances of the
<i>persons</i> licensed in 10<i>l.</i>, and two sureties of 5<i>l.</i>, for <i>good
conduct</i>, with other restrictions.</p>

<p>The page of events at this time is eminently instructive.
A government cannot be far in advance of the
people whom it governs. Extreme repression has been
and ever will be evaded. In the present instance, not
only was a demand for beer created, but resort was had
to any and every expedient to glut the appetite upon
the favourite spirit. The clandestine sale of gin was
the natural consequence. The gaols groaned under the
burden of atonement for unpaid penalties. Within two
years of the passing of the Gin Act some twelve thousand
persons had been punished for its violation. The
measure proved a failure, for (as Smollett observes) though
no licence was obtained, and no duty paid, the liqu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>or
continued to be sold in all corners of the streets; informers
were intimidated by the threats of the people,
and the justices of the peace, either from indolence or
corruption, neglected to put the law into execution.</p>

<p>It is important to compare the consumption of low
wines (weak spirits) and spirits, before and after the
passing of the Act. The total consumption for England
and Wales in 1733 was 11,282,890 gallons; and in
1742 the consumption was 19,897,300 gallons. No
wonder that the Act was repealed. Had the Government
imposed a graduated scale of duty upon spirits, a
scale ever sliding upwards, their price might have been
raised by almost insensible stages, till the means of purchase
would have been well-nigh precluded.</p>

<p>But in other directions a wiser legislation found
favour. Distillation from grain, malt, or flour was
prohibited, and when it was proposed in Parliament to
relax this measure, abundant were the petitions for its
retention. It was therefore resolved that the law should
be in force till December 1759: and the success of the
measure is established from the fact that the consumption
of spirits in England and Wales fell, from the nineteen
millions of 1742, to an annual average of about
four millions during the interval between the years 1760
and 1782.</p>

<p>Much is said in the present day of female intemperance.
The Lords&rsquo; Committee had aroused public attention
to the subject. But it was rife enough in the period
under discussion. A poet of the century makes no secret
of the proclivity.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The following incident related in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for 1748, points to a terrible condition of
things:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At a christening at Beddington in Surrey, the nurse was so
intoxicated that after she had undress&rsquo;d the child, instead of laying
it in the cradle, she put it behind a large fire, which burnt it to
death in a few minutes. She was examin&rsquo;d before a magistrate,
and said she was quite stupid and senseless, so that she took the
child for a log of wood; on which she was discharged!!</p></div>

<p>Nor was any class of society exempt from the imputation;
but the curtain need not be drawn.</p>

<p>And what a stream of ability and learning was polluted
by those mischievous compounds! Men of letters,
tragedians, statesmen, fell&mdash;ignobly fell&mdash;before the insidious
destroyer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bolingbroke, when in office, sat up whole nights drinking, and
in the morning, having bound a wet napkin round his forehead and
his eyes, to drive away the effects of his intemperance, he hastened
without sleep to his official business.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Stair, in a letter to Horace Walpole, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Poor Harry (Bolingbroke) is turned out from being Secretary of
State.... They call him knave and traitor.... I believe all poor
Harry&rsquo;s fault was that he could not play his part with a grave
enough face.... He got drunk now and then.</p></div>

<p>Lord Cartaret, afterwards Earl Granville, was a great
scholar, and a man of invariable high spirits.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The period of his ascendency was known by the name of the
<i>Drunken Administration</i>; and the expression was not altogether
figurative. His habits were extremely convivial; and champagne
probably lent its aid to keep him in that state of joyous excitement
in which his life was passed.... Driven from office, he retired
laughing to his books and his bottle.... Ill as he had been used,
he did not seem, says Horace Walpole, to have any resentment, or
indeed any feeling except thirst.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p></div>

<p>Macaulay implies that Cartaret occasionally varied
his champagne for &lsquo;a daily half gallon of Burgundy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>William Pulteney, created &lsquo;Earl of Bath&rsquo; on the
resignation of Walpole, has been generally reckoned
amongst the men of the bottle. Indeed, Mr. Lecky
remarks (i. 478) that he &lsquo;is said to have shortened his
life by drinking.&rsquo; But how can this be? He lived to
the fairly respectable age of 82. Has he not been confounded
with some namesake? For what says this
same author in another volume?&mdash;&lsquo;Lord Bath, the old
rival of Walpole, subscribed liberally to the orphanage
of Georgia, and was a frequent and apparently devout
attendant at Whitefield&rsquo;s Chapel in Tottenham Court
Road.&rsquo; In fact in his old age he became a Methodist.
Was such a man likely to be a hard drinker?</p>

<p>Of Walpole, Mr. Lecky remarks, that when he was a
young man, his father was accustomed to pour into his
glass a double portion of wine, saying, &lsquo;Come, Robert,
you shall drink twice while I drink once; for I will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>permit the son in his sober senses to be witness of the
intoxication of his father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It speaks volumes for the son of such a father, that
when Mr. Chute gibed him for stupidity, which he set
down to &lsquo;temperance diet,&rsquo; Walpole protested, saying, &lsquo;I
have such lamentable proofs every day of the stupefying
qualities of beef, ale, and wine, that I have contracted a
most religious veneration for your spiritual <i>nourriture</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Methodism, drinking, and gambling, were all on the
increase. So says Walpole. Of the first, he sarcastically
says,&mdash;&lsquo;It increases as fast as any religious nonsense
did.&rsquo; Of the second he remarks,&mdash;&lsquo;Drinking is at the
highest wine-mark.&rsquo; But people were gluttons as well
as drunkards.</p>

<p>The aristocracy of letters were infected, no less than
that of rank. Truly did Chesterfield observe, that wine
and wassail have taken more strong places than gun or
steel. Jonathan Swift is generally regarded as a free
liver, though probably the company he kept is often
answerable for the imputation. The following notices
must serve as material for judgment. Dr. King states
that about three years before his death, he observed that
he was affected by the wine which he drank after dinner;
next day, on his complaining of his health, he took the
liberty to tell him he had drunk too much wine. Swift
was startled, and replied that he always regarded himself
as a very temperate man, and never exceeded the
quantity his physician prescribed. But, according to
King, his physician never drank less than two bottles of
claret after dinner. But King was a water-drinker.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
Scott says of Swift&rsquo;s entertainments that they were
economical, &lsquo;although his guests, so far as conviviality
was consistent with decorum, were welcomed with excellent
wine. Swift, who used to declare he was never intoxicat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ed
in his life, had nevertheless lived intimately
with those at whose tables wine was liberally consumed,
and he was not himself averse to the moderate use of it.&rsquo;
The same author adds that Dr. King said that Swift
drank about a pint of claret after dinner, which the
doctor considered too much.</p>

<p>On the other hand his satirists accused him of excess.
One of them says, &lsquo;He was heard to make some
self-denying promises in prayer, that, for the time to
come, he would stint himself to two or three bottles in
an evening.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Again, the Archbishop of Cashel seems
to have known his weak point. In a letter, inviting him
on a visit, and giving him minute instructions as to the
route, he baits him by the intelligence that he would
pass a parson&rsquo;s cabin where was a private cellar of which
the parson kept the key, in which was always a hogshead
of the best wine that could be got, in bottles well-corked,
upon their side.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>His poems often betrayed the flavour of the bottle.
Witness his <i>Country Quarter Sessions</i>, which begins:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Three or four parsons full of October,<br />
Three or four squires between drunk and sober.<br />
</p>

<p>Again, in his <i>Baucis and Philemon</i>; Goody Baucis in
bestirring herself to provide the hermit&rsquo;s hospitality&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Then stepp&rsquo;d aside to fetch &lsquo;em drink,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>Fill&rsquo;d a large jug up to the brink,<br />
And saw it fairly twice go round.<br />
</p>

<p>Somerville, the author of <i>The Chase</i>, was no doubt
fond of the bottle, as we see very clearly from the letter
of his friend Shenstone after his death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our old friend Somerville is dead! I did not imagine I could
have been so sorry as I find myself on this occasion.&mdash;<i>Sublatum
quærimus.</i> I can now excuse all his foibles; impute them to age,
and to distress of circumstances: the last of these considerations
wrings my very soul to think on. For a man of high spirit, conscious
of having (at least in one production) generally pleased the
world, to be plagued and threatened by wretches that are low in
every sense; <i>to be forced to drink himself into pains of the body,
in order to get rid of the pains of the mind, is a misery</i>.</p></div>

<p>James Quin the tragedian was a <i>bon vivant</i>. After
being engaged at Drury Lane Theatre, a tavern brawl
involved him in law proceedings, and he was obliged for
a time to leave the country. His epitaph, by Garrick,
depicts the man:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
A plague on Egypt&rsquo;s arts! I say;<br />
Embalm the dead, on senseless clay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich wines and spices waste!</span><br />
Like sturgeon, or like brawn, shall I,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I shall never taste.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mummy ready made.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Richard Savage lived a very profligate life. Johnson
says that &lsquo;in no time of his life was it any part of his
character to be the first of the company that desired to
separate.&rsquo; It was when inebriated that he killed one Mr.
James Sinclair, 1727, and was within an ace of being
hanged for the same. Lord Tyrconnel, who had been
very kind to him, and suddenly dropped him, gives a
very bad account of his drinking habits.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>He affirmed that it was the constant practice of Mr. Savage to
enter a tavern with any company that proposed it, drink the most
expensive wines with great profusion, and when the reckoning was
demanded, be without money: if, as it often happened, his company
were willing to defray his part, the affair ended without any ill consequences;
but if they were refractory, and expected that the wine
should be paid for by him that drank it, his method of composition
was to take them with him to his own apartment, assume the
government of the house, and order the butler in an imperious
manner to set the best wine in the cellar before his company, who
often drank till they forgot the respect due to the house in which
they were entertained, indulged themselves in the utmost extravagance
of merriment, practised the most licentious frolics, and committed
all the outrages of drunkenness.</p></div>

<p>No wonder Lord Tyrconnel dropped him. Even Savage
himself admitted that Lord Tyrconnel &lsquo;often exhorted
him to regulate his method of life, <i>and not to spend all
his nights in taverns</i>, and that he appeared desirous that
he would pass those hours with him, which he so freely
bestowed upon others.&rsquo; The poor fellow eventually, having
estranged all his friends by his petulance as well as
his bad habits, got deplorably poor, and &lsquo;wandered about
the town, slighted and neglected, in quest of a dinner,
which he did not always obtain.&rsquo; It was at this period
that we read the extraordinary account of him, that &lsquo;he
was not able to bear the smell of meat till the action of
his stomach was restored by a cordial.&rsquo; On one occasion
in great distress at Bristol, &lsquo;he received a remittance
of five pounds from London, with which he provided
himself a decent coat, and determined to go to
London, but unhappily spent his money at a favourite
tavern.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The tale goes on, &lsquo;Thus was he again confined to
Bristol, where he was every day hunted by bailiffs. In
this exigence he once more found a friend, who sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
him in his house, though at the usual inconveniences
with which his company was attended; for he could
neither be persuaded to go to bed in the night nor to
rise in the day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But if many were the victims of excess, many too
were the champions of restraint; and, first of all, we
turn to Dr. Samuel Johnson. In his early life he drank
wine; let him testify for himself.</p>

<p>In an interesting conversation with an old college
friend, one Edwards, held April 17, 1778, he made a
remark which Sir Wilfrid Lawson would hail:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Edwards.</i> How do you live, sir? For my part, I must have
my regular meals and a glass of good wine. I find I require it.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> I now drink no wine, sir. Early in life I drank wine;
for many years I drank none. I then for some years drank a good
deal....</p>

<p><i>Edwards.</i> I am grown old: I am sixty-five.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> I shall be sixty-eight next birthday. Come, sir,
<span class="smcap">drink water, and put in for a hundred</span>.</p></div>

<p>When he first came to London, at the age of 29, he
abstained entirely (<i>teste</i> Boswell) from fermented liquors,
&lsquo;a practice to which he rigidly conformed for many years
together at different periods of his life.&rsquo; Upon this point
Croker has a suggestive note, apropos of the effect of drink
on hypochondria:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At this time his abstinence from wine may perhaps be attributed
to poverty, but in his subsequent life he was restrained from that
indulgence by, as it appears, moral, or rather medical, considerations.
He found by experience that wine, though it dissipated for a moment,
yet eventually aggravated the hereditary disease under which he
suffered; and perhaps it may have been owing to a long course of
abstinence that his mental health seems to have been better in the
latter than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> earlier portion of his life. He says, in his <i>Prayers
and Meditations</i> (August 17, 1767), &lsquo;By abstinence from wine and
suppers I obtained sudden and great relief, and had freedom of
mind restored to me; which I have wanted for all this year, without
being able to find any means of obtaining it.&rsquo; These remarks are
important, because <i>depression of spirits</i> is too often treated on a
contrary system, from ignorance of or <i>inattention to what may be</i>
its <i>real</i> cause.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Johnson was very often chiefly indebted to <i>tea</i>
for his literary afflatus. &lsquo;The quantities which he drank
of the infusion of that fragrant leaf,&rsquo; says Boswell, &lsquo;at
all hours were so great, that his nerves must have been
uncommonly strong, not to have been extremely relaxed
by such an intemperate use of it.&rsquo; In his defence of Tea
against Mr. Jonas Hanway, Johnson describes himself as
&lsquo;a hardened and shameless tea-drinker, who has for
many years diluted his meals with only the infusion of
this fascinating plant; whose kettle has scarcely time to
cool; who with tea amuses the evening, with tea solaces
the midnights, and with tea welcomes the morning.&rsquo;
This last phrase his friend, Tom Tyers, happily parodied,
&lsquo;<i>te</i> veniente die&mdash;<i>te</i> decedente.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Boswell often pauses to descant upon</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Temperance</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>September 16, 1773.</i>&mdash;Last night much care was taken of Dr.
Johnson, who was still distressed by his cold. He had hitherto
most strangely slept without a nightcap. Miss Macleod made him
a large flannel one, and he was prevailed with to drink a little
brandy when he was going to bed. He has great virtue in not
drinking wine or any fermented liquor because, as he acknowledged
to us, he could not do it in moderation. Lady Macleod would
hardly believe him, and said, &lsquo;I am sure, sir, you would not carry
it too far.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Johnson.</i> &lsquo;Nay, madam, it carried me. I took the
opportunity of a long illness to leave it off. It was then prescribed
to me not to drink wine; and, having broken off the habit, I have
never returned to it.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>Again, says Boswell:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A.D. 1776.&mdash;Finding him still persevering in his abstinence
from wine, I ventured to speak to him of it.&mdash;<i>Johnson.</i> Sir, I have
no objection to a man&rsquo;s drinking wine, if he can do it in moderation.
I found myself apt to go into excess in it, and therefore, after
having been for some time without it on account of illness, I
thought it better not to return to it. Every man is to judge for
himself, according to the effects which he experiences. One of the
fathers tells us he found fasting made him so peevish that he did
not practise it.</p></div>

<p>Dr. B. W. Richardson&rsquo;s ideas about the harm done
to constitutions by excessive palpitation of the heart
(especially under the action of alcohol) seem to have had
shadows cast before. Boswell&rsquo;s hero rather pooh-poohed
the idea, in a conversation after dinner at Thrale&rsquo;s,
April 10, 1776:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Johnson mentioned Dr. Barry&rsquo;s System of Physic. &lsquo;He was a
man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;who had acquired a high reputation in Dublin, came
over to England, and brought his reputation with him. <span class="smcap">His notion
was, that pulsation occasions death by attrition, and that
therefore the way to preserve life is to retard pulsation.</span>
But we know that pulsation is strongest in infants, and that we
increase in growth while it operates in its regular course; so it
cannot well be the cause of destruction.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>This Barry became a Baronet&mdash;<i>Sir Edward Barry,
Bart.</i> &lsquo;He published, in 1775, a curious work on the
Wines of the Ancients.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that when Dr. Johnson
did drink, he drank heavily. On April 7, 1778, he said
he had drunk three bottles of port at a time without being
the worse for it. &lsquo;University College has witnessed
this.&rsquo; He could practise abstinence, but not temperance.</p>

<p>Boswell&rsquo;s own ideas upon drinking are worth
recording:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I observed [says he of himself, April 12, 1776] that wine did
some people harm, by inflaming, confusing, and irritat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>ing their
minds; but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour
of moderate drinking.</p></div>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds on the same occasion expressed
similar ideas. He argued that &lsquo;a moderate glass enlivened
the mind, by giving a proper circulation to the blood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Probably Reynolds had studied the <i>Familiar Letters</i>
of the Historiographer-Royal, Howell, who, as before
noticed, thought that &lsquo;good wine makes good blood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Johnson lived to see, as he believed, a change for the
better, in the direction of temperance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Anno Domini 1773.</i>&mdash;We talked of change of manners. Dr.
Johnson observed that our drinking less than our ancestors was
owing to the change from ale to wine. &lsquo;I remember,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;when all the <i>decent</i> people in Lichfield got drunk every night, and
were not the worse thought of. Ale was cheap, so you pressed
strongly. When a man must bring a bottle of wine, he is not in
such haste.&rsquo; [Johnson was sixty-four at the time.]</p></div>

<p>It seems strange that Johnson&rsquo;s influence over his
minion&rsquo;s habits was so slight. At any rate the following
anecdote points to this conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Lord Eldon tells us, in his &lsquo;Anecdote Book,&rsquo; that at an assize in
Lancaster about the year 1782, Jemmy Boswell, the biographer of
Dr. Johnson, was found dead drunk and stretched upon the pavement.
His merry colleagues, of whom the sage Lord Eldon was
one, subscribed among them a guinea at supper, which they sent
next morning to Boswell, with instructions to move in Court for the
writ of &lsquo;Quare adhæsit pavimento.&rsquo; In vain did the perplexed and
bibulous barrister apply to all the attorneys of his acquaintance for
information as to the nature of the writ for which he was instructed
to move, and great was the astonishment of the Judge when the
application was made to him. At last one of the Bar, amidst the
laughter of the Court, exclaimed, &lsquo;My Lord, Mr. Boswell adhæsit
pavimento last night. There was no moving him for some time.
At length he was carried to bed, and has been dreaming of what
happened to himself.&rsquo;</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that Johnson should have been
guilty of the <i>lapsus linguæ</i> for which Bacchanalians have
often claimed him as their hero, and by which careful
historians have been misled. Mr. Mallet, speaking of
the Icelanders of the middle ages, tells that &lsquo;after they
had finished eating their boiled horseflesh, they generally
sat swilling their ale out of capacious drinking-horns
and listening to the lay of a skald, or the tale of a Saga-man,
until they were most of them in that happy state
of mind, when, according to Johnson, man is alone
capable of enjoying the passing moment of his fleeting
existence.&rsquo; He refers doubtless to a saying of the
<i>savant</i> recorded by his biographer. Johnson being asked
whether a man was not sometimes happy in the moment
that was present, answered, &lsquo;Never but when he is drunk.&rsquo;
Most Johnsonians would readily admit that this was a
<i>lapsus</i>, a sally of the moment, not his deliberate judgment,
such as is obtainable from a set work like his incomparable
<i>Rasselas</i>. There we read:&mdash;&lsquo;Intemperance,
though it may fire the spirits for an hour, will make life
short or miserable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith, in <i>The Bee</i>, has some pungent
observations upon <i>ale-houses</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ale-houses are ever an occasion of debauchery and excess, and
either in a religious or political light it would be our highest interest
to have the greatest part of them suppressed. They should be put
under laws of not continuing open beyond a certain hour, and harbouring
only proper persons. These rules, it may be said, will
diminish the necessary taxes; but this is false reasoning, since what
was consumed in debauchery abroad would, if such a regulation
took place, be more justly and perhaps more equitably for the
workman&rsquo;s family spent at home: and this, cheaper to them and
without loss of time. On the other hand, our ale-houses, being ever
open, interrupt business.</p></div>

<p>This same delightful author wrote that convivial
satire entitled <i>The Three Pigeons</i>, which he put into the
mouth of Tony Lumpkin in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, of
which the following is a part:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With grammar, and nonsense, and learning;</span><br />
Good liquor, I stoutly maintain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gives <i>genus</i> a better discerning.</span><br />
<br />
When Methodist preachers come down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-preaching that drinking is sinful,</span><br />
I&rsquo;ll wager the rascals a crown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They always preach best with a skin-full.</span><br />
<br />
Then come, put the jorum about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let us be merry and clever;</span><br />
Our hearts and our liquors are stout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here&rsquo;s the Three Jolly Pigeons for ever!</span><br />
</p>

<p>Shenstone, another contemporary poet, though he
spent so large a portion of his time in adorning The
Leasowes, till he had made it a kind of rural paradise,
could also rave about the <i>freedom</i> of an <i>inn</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;Tis here with boundless power I reign,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every health which I begin</span><br />
Converts dull port to bright champagne;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such freedom crowns it at an inn.</span><br />
<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er has travelled life&rsquo;s dull round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where&rsquo;er his stages may have been,</span><br />
May sigh to think he still has found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The warmest welcome at an inn.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And the same spirit breathes again in the <i>Deserted
Village</i> of Goldsmith. The village ale-house is clearly
included among the &lsquo;simple blessings of the lowly train.&rsquo;
Yet there is nothing to condemn in the sentiments there
expressed, and we may echo the words of Sir Walter
Scott:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>The wreath of Goldsmith is unsullied; he wrote to exalt virtue
and expose vice; and he accomplished his task in a manner which
raises him to the highest rank among British authors.</p></div>

<p>But we pass on to notice the man who did more
than any one of his time to expose vice, and in particular
the vice of intemperance. And this is not surprising
when we consider the remarkable manner in which his
genius for painting discovered itself.</p>

<p>Going out one Sunday with some companions to Highgate,
they went into an inn, where they had not been
long, before a quarrel arose between some persons in the
same room. One of the disputants struck the other on
the head with a quart pot, which cut him badly, and the
blood ran down his face freely. This, with the contortions
of his countenance, afforded a striking object to
Hogarth, who drew out his pencil and sketched the
scene.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient for the present purpose to note
the part which drink plays in his <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>,
the <i>Rake&rsquo;s Progress</i>, and in two miscellaneous Plates.
In the first mentioned, Counsellor Silvertongue begins
his vile work of ensnaring the Viscountess by offering her
a glass of light wine at an interval between the dances.
Plate ii. represents the Viscount returning home the day
after the entertainment. His appearance denotes that
he has been involved in some drunken fray. Plate vi.
depicts &lsquo;sin when it is finished,&rsquo; the suicide of the beguiled
Viscountess by means of laudanum.</p>

<p>Plate iii. of the <i>Rake&rsquo;s Progress</i> illustrates the &lsquo;orgie
at the Rose Tavern.&rsquo; Young Rakewell is lavishly expending
his money in plying with drink the caressing
courtesans. He himself becomes intoxicated, and is of
course robbed of his watch and jewellery; one of the
wretched women, in a fit of rage, sets fire to a map of the
world, swearing that she will burn the entire globe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>and
herself with it. The reflections of the morrow can be
easily imagined.</p>

<p>In <i>Gin Lane</i>, the artist portrays a loathsome neighbourhood,
the presiding genius of which is <i>gin</i>. To procure
it no means are left untried. Every article of
domestic comfort, even to the meanest shred of raiment,
is carried to the pawnbroker for the wherewithal to purchase
gin. The influence of this fire-water is everywhere
apparent; in the ruined dwellings, in the sickly looks,
in the emaciated frames, trembling limbs, carious teeth,
livid lips, and sunken eyes. The very children in that
region are habituated from the cradle to love gin. The
one house that thrives is that of the pawnbroker. The
details are agonising! a child ravenous, gnawing a bare
bone, which a dog, equally the victim of famine, is snatching
from him. A woman is seen pouring a dram down
the throat of an infant. In a ruined house, the corpse
of a hanging suicide is displayed. A drunken object is
drawn, in female shape, whose legs have broken out in
horrible ulcers, and who is taking snuff, regardless of
her child slipping from her arms into the low area of the
gin vault. Gin too has killed the female whom we see
two men placing in a shell by order of the beadle, while
the orphan child is being conveyed to the Union.</p>

<p>Well did the Reverend James Townley underwrite:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Gin, cursed fiend! with fury fraught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes human race a prey;</span><br />
It enters by a deadly draught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And steals our life away.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>Virtue and Truth, driv&rsquo;n to despair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its rage compels to fly;</span><br />
But cherishes, with hellish care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Theft, Murder, Perjury.</span><br />
<br />
Damn&rsquo;d cup! that on the vitals preys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That liquid fire contains,</span><br />
Which madness to the heart conveys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rolls it through the veins.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The general design of the Plate <i>Beer Street</i> is to expose
the deadly habit of gin-drinking, and to teach that
if man must drink strong liquors, beer is far the best to
indulge in.</p>

<p>Edward Young, courtier, poet, rector, a general genius,
satirised tea and wine as abused by the women of his
day. After bemoaning the hecatomb sacrificed upon the
altar of <i>tea</i>, he exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But this inhuman triumph shall decline,<br />
And thy revolting Naiads call for wine;<br />
Spirits no longer shall serve under thee,<br />
But reign in thy own cup, exploded Tea!<br />
Citronia&rsquo;s nose declares thy ruin nigh;<br />
And who dares give Citronia&rsquo;s nose the lie?<br />
The ladies long at men of drink exclaimed,<br />
And what impaired both health and virtue blamed.<br />
At length, to rescue man, the generous lass<br />
Stole from her consort the pernicious glass,<br />
As glorious as the British Queen renown&rsquo;d<br />
Who suck&rsquo;d the poison from her husband&rsquo;s wound.<br />
</p>

<p>Another champion of temperance was John Armstrong,
who wrote in 1744 <i>The Art of Preserving Health</i>. But
he was no ascetic, for he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">When you smooth</span><br />
The brows of care, indulge your festive vein<br />
In cups by well-informed experience found<br />
The least your bane, and only with your friends.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>The effects of a surfeit of drink he has most ably
drawn:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But most too passive, when the blood runs low,</span><br />
Too weakly indolent to strive with pain,<br />
And bravely by resisting conquer fate,<br />
Try Circe&rsquo;s arts; and in the tempting bowl<br />
Of poisoned nectar sweet oblivion swill.<br />
Struck by the powerful charm, the gloom dissolves<br />
In empty air; Elysium opens round,<br />
A pleasing frenzy buoys the lightened soul,<br />
And sanguine hopes dispel your fleeting care;<br />
And what was difficult, and what was dire,<br />
Yields to your prowess and superior stars:<br />
The happiest you of all that e&rsquo;er were mad,<br />
Or are, or shall be, could this folly last.<br />
But soon your heaven is gone: a heavier gloom<br />
Shuts o&rsquo;er your head; and, as the thundering stream,<br />
Swollen o&rsquo;er its banks with sudden mountain rain,<br />
Sinks from its tumult to a silent brook,<br />
So, when the frantic raptures in your breast<br />
Subside, you languish into mortal man;<br />
You sleep, and waking find yourself undone,<br />
For, prodigal of life, in one rash night<br />
You lavished more than might support three days.<br />
A heavy morning comes; your cares return<br />
With tenfold rage. An anxious stomach well<br />
May be endured; so may the throbbing head;<br />
But such a dim delirium, such a dream,<br />
Involves you; such a dastardly despair<br />
Unmans your soul, as maddening Pentheus felt,<br />
When, baited round Cithæron&rsquo;s cruel sides,<br />
He saw two suns, and double Thebes ascend.<br />
</p>

<p>How does this remind of the rich fool in the parable!
The earlier lines of irony seem almost taken in idea
from some sentiments of Hafiz, the favourite poet of the
Persians.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am [says he] neither a judge nor a priest, nor a censor, nor a
lawyer; why should I forbid the use of wine?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
<p>Do not be vexed at the trifles of the world; drink, for it is folly
for a wise man to be afflicted....</p>

<p>The only friends who are free from care are a goblet of wine and
a book of odes.</p>

<p>Give me wine! wine that shall subdue the strongest: that I
may for a time forget the cares and troubles of the world.</p></div>

<p>Armstrong joined in the general growl at the substitution
of port for the lighter French wine.</p>

<p>In describing a man&rsquo;s sensations on awaking he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
You curse the sluggish port, you curse the wretch,<br />
The felon, with unnatural mixture, first<br />
Who dared to violate the virgin wine.<br />
</p>

<p>Again, when speaking of wholesome wine, he
praises:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The gay, serene, good-natured Burgundy,<br />
Or the fresh fragrant vintage of the Rhine.<br />
</p>

<p>Again, he describes Burgundy as the drink for gentlemen,
and port as an abomination:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The man to well-bred Burgundy brought up,<br />
Will start the smack of <i>Methuen</i> in the cup.<br />
</p>

<p>What Armstrong said one hundred and thirty years ago I
entreat my medical brethren to believe now. I repeat it: if you
want to prescribe <i>spirits</i>, do so; if you want to give <i>wine</i>, give
<i>pure</i> wine. One bottle of good Burgundy will give twice the
flavour and half the spirit that port does.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>In 1735 was published <i>A Friendly Admonition to the
Drinkers of Brandy and other Distilled Spirituous Liquors</i>.
The author laments that man has found means to extract
from what God intended for his refreshment, a most
pernicious and intoxicating liquor. Singularly does this
anonymous writer anticipate the results of modern inquiries.
He tells us that distilled liquors <i>coagulate and
thicken the blood, contract and narrow the blood-vessels</i>, as
has been proved by <i>experiments purposely made</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whence [says he] we may evidently see the reason why those
liquors do so frequently cause <i>Obstructions</i> and <i>Stoppages</i> in the
<i>Liver</i>; whence the <i>Jaundice</i>, <i>Dropsy</i>, and many other fatal
Diseases: It is in like manner also that they destroy and burn up
the <i>Lungs</i> too: Hence also it is, that by frequently contracting and
shrivelling, and then soon after relaxing, they weaken and wear out
the Substance and Coats of the Stomach, on which they more
immediately prey, every time they are drank: Hence, I say, it is,
that these spirituous Liquors rarely fail to destroy the Appetite and
Digestion of those who habituate themselves to them; for by
drying up, and spoiling the Nerves, they make them insensible;
they destroy also many of the very fine Blood-Vessels, especially
where their Fibres are most tender, as in the Brain; whereby they
spoil the Memory and intellectual Faculties: And by thus inflaming
the Blood, and disordering the Blood Vessels and Nerves, they
vitiate and deprave the <i>Natural Temper</i>.</p>

<p>When first drank, they seem to comfort the Stomach, by contracting
its too relaxed and flabby Fibres, and also to warm the
Blood; but as the Warmth which they give, on mixing with the
Blood, soon goes off, as it is in fact found to do, when we mix
Brandy with Blood; so also the spirituous Part of the Brandy
being soon dissolved, and soaking into the watery Humours of the
Body, it can no longer contract and warm the Substance and Coats
of the Stomach and other Parts; which therefore as soon relaxing,
the unhappy persons are thereby in a little time reduced to
a cold, languid, and dispirited state, which gives them so much
uneasiness that they are impatient to get out of it by Supplies of the
same deadly Liquor, which, instead of curing, daily increases their
Disease more and more.</p></div>

<p>But the worst is not yet told.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As when immediately put into the Veins of an Animal they
cause sudden Death, so when drank in a large Quantity at once,
they coagulate and thicken the Blood to such a degree <i>as to kill
instantly</i>: And when they are not drank in such Quantities as to
kill immediately, but are daily used, then, besides many other
Di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>seases, they are apt to breed <i>Polypuses</i>, or fleshy Substances in
the Heart, by thickening the Blood there; which <i>Polypuses</i>, as
they grow larger and larger, do, by hindering and retarding the
Motion of the Blood through the Heart, thereby farther contribute
to the Faintness and Dispiritedness of those unhappy Persons, and
at length, by totally stopping the Course of the Blood, do as effectually
kill, as if a Dart had been struck thro&rsquo; the Liver.</p></div>

<p>And again, speaking of these same spirituous liquors,
he adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some may indeed be more palatable than others, <i>but they are
all in a manner equally pernicious and dangerous, that are of an
equal Strength; and those most destructive and deadly, which are
the strongest, that is, which have most Spirit in them</i>. Which
<i>Spirit</i> being of a very harsh, fiery, and acrimonious Nature, as it
is found to seize on and harden raw Flesh put into it; so does it
greatly injure the Stomach, Bowels, Liver, and all other Parts of
human Bodies, especially the Nerves; which being the immediate
and principal Instruments of Life and Action, hence it is, that it so
remarkably enfeebles the habitual Drinkers of it; and also depraves
the Memory, by hardening and spoiling the Substance of the Brain,
which is the Seat of Life, and this is an Inconvenience which the
great Drinkers of <i>Punch</i> often find, as well as the <i>Dram</i> Drinkers.</p></div>

<p>Fifteen years later (1751) a Scotchman, James Burgh
(cousin to the historian Robertson), wrote <i>A warning to
Dram-Drinkers</i>. Would that it had been effectual!</p>

<p>At this time <i>cider</i> seems to have risen to the dignity
of civic feasts. At a feast held Nov. 5th, 1737, at an inn,
the following are the charges:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1746 <i>A Bowl of Punch</i> appears as a novelty in the
bill of a corporation dinner. When Coade was Mayor in
1737, sixteen bowls of punch were drunk at a corporation
banquet.</p>

<p><i>Whitsun-ales</i> were still in force. In the postscript of
a letter from a minister to his parishioners in the Deanery
of Stow, Gloucestershire, 1736, the author writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What I have now been desiring you to consider as touching the
evil and pernicious consequences of <i>Whitsun-ales</i> among us, doth
also obtain against Dovers Meeting ... and also against <i>Midsummer
Ales</i> and <i>Mead-mowings</i>; and likewise against the ordinary
violations of those festival seasons commonly called <i>Wakes</i>.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1735 occurred a scene which fairly gives
colour to the <i>Secret History of the Calves&rsquo; Head Club</i>.
The following account is given in the letters of L&rsquo;Abbé
Le Blanc:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some young men of quality chose to abandon themselves to the
debauchery of drinking healths on the 30th of January, a day
appointed by the Church of England for a general fast, to expiate
the murder of Charles I., whom they honour as a martyr. As soon
as they were heated with wine, they began to sing. This gave
great offence to the people, who stopped before the tavern, and gave
them abusive language. One of these rash young men put his head
out of the window and drank to the memory of the army which dethroned
this king, and to the rebels which cut off his head upon a
scaffold. The stones immediately flew from all parts, the furious
populace broke the windows of the house, and would have set fire
to it.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chapter Coffeehouse was opened at this time,
famous for punch, pamphlets, and newspapers. Buchan,
of <i>Domestic Medicine</i> fame, was an <i>habitué</i>; so was Dr.
Gower.</p>

<p>These eminent physicians sat and prescribed for the
maladies of their mates, <i>Chapter punch</i>; &lsquo;If one won&rsquo;t
do, call for a second.&rsquo; But clubs, whatever they may
have been, are anything but unfavourable to temperance
<i>now</i>. The worst that can be honestly thought of them
is&mdash;that they <i>may</i> minister to selfishness.</p>

<p>Thus are clubs an exception to the usual tendency
of the moral law of gravitation&mdash;downwards. What is
there in common, save the name, between the <i>Athenæum</i>
of to-day, and the <i>Roxburghe</i> of the beginning of the
century?</p>

<p>The entertainments of the latter have found their
way into print under the title &lsquo;<i>Roxburghe Revels; or, An
Account of the Annual Display</i>, culinary and festivous,
interspersed incidentally with matters of Moment or
Merryment.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>George III. was an example of <i>moderation</i>. One of
his biographers, Edward Holt, observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Exercise, air, and little diet were the grand fundamentals in the
King&rsquo;s idea of health and sprightliness: his Majesty fed chiefly on
vegetables and drank little wine. The Queen was what many
private gentlewomen styled whimsically abstemious.</p></div>

<p>The story is told that at Worcester, the mayor, knowing
that the King never took drink before dinner, asked him
if he would be pleased to take a jelly, when the King
replied: &lsquo;I do not recollect drinking a glass of wine
before dinner in my life, yet upon this pleasing occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>I will venture.&rsquo; A glass of rich old <i>Mountain</i> was
served, when his Majesty immediately drank &lsquo;Prosperity
to the Corporation and Citizens of Worcester.&rsquo; This
occurred in the twenty-eighth year of the King&rsquo;s reign
(1788). The rigid rule was still observed by his Majesty,
as we learn from an incident which occurred twelve
years later. One morning, when visiting as usual his
stables, the King heard the following conversation between
the grooms: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you say, Robert,
but every one agrees that the man at the <i>Three Tuns</i>
makes the best purl in Windsor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Purl, purl!&rsquo; said the
King, quickly. &lsquo;Robert, what&rsquo;s purl?&rsquo; This was explained
to be warm beer with a glass of gin, &amp;c. His
Majesty listened attentively, and turning round, said: &lsquo;I
dare say, very good drink, but too strong for the morning;
never drink in a morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the description of the King&rsquo;s visit to Whitbread&rsquo;s
brewery, we learn incidentally the large scale on which
even then the wholesale trade was conducted&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in
the great store were three thousand and seven barrels of
beer. The stone cistern, into which he entered, held
four thousand barrels of beer. The royal party were
offered some of Whitbread&rsquo;s <i>entire</i>.</p>

<p>The King drank and responded to <i>toasts</i>. Thus, at
a dinner of <i>The Knights</i>, we read that towards the end of
the first course, a large gilt cup was brought to the
Sovereign by the cupbearer. The King drank to the
knights, who, being at his Majesty&rsquo;s command, informed
of the same by Garter, stood up uncovered, pledged the
King, and then sat down.</p>

<p>At the jubilee, the commemoration of the fiftieth
year of the King&rsquo;s reign, the mayor at the banquet gave
&lsquo;The King, God bless him, and long may he reign over
a free and united people,&rsquo; which was drunk with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
times three.</p>

<p>The general habits of the time formed a striking
contrast to the personal example of the King. In the
recently issued elaborate <i>Life of George IV.</i>, by Percy
Fitzgerald, we get a picture into the social manners and
customs prevailing about 1787:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&lsquo;How the men of business and the great orators of the House of
Commons contrive to reconcile it with their exertions I cannot
conceive,&rsquo; writes that most charming of public men, Sir Gilbert
Elliot, to his wife. &lsquo;Men of all ages drink abominably. Fox (a
Prime Minister) drinks what I should call a great deal, though he
is not reckoned to do so by his companions; Sheridan (M.P. and
dramatist, and withal the bosom friend of the Prince of Wales,
afterwards George IV.) excessively; and Grey (Viscount Howick)
more than any of them. But it is in a much more gentlemanly
way than our Scotch drunkards, and is always accompanied with
lively clever conversation on subjects of importance. Pitt (a
Prime Minister), I am told, drinks as much as anybody.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The same observer, Sir Gilbert Elliot (1787), describes a scene
at W. Crewe&rsquo;s, where three young men of fashion, Mr. Orlando
Bridgman, Mr. Charles Greville, of the Picnic Club, and Mr.
Gifford were so drunk, &lsquo;as to puzzle the whole assembly.&rsquo; The
last was a young gentleman lately come out, of a good estate of
about five thousand pounds a year, the whole of which he is in the
act of spending in one or two years at least (125,000<i>l.</i>), and this
without a grain of sense, without any fun to himself or entertainment
to others.
He never uttered a word, though as drunk as the other two, who
were both riotous, and began at last to talk so plain, that Lady
Francis and Lady Valentine fled from the side table to ours, and
Mrs. Sheridan would have followed them, but did not escape till
her arms were black and blue, and her apron torn off.</p>

<p>Pitt, the model young minister, broke down in the house in
the following year, owing to a debauch the night before at Lord
Buckingham&rsquo;s, when, in company with Dundas and the Duke of
Gordon, he took too much wine.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
<p>Indeed, the manners and customs of the times (1780-1830)
might be called a &lsquo;precious school&rsquo; for the young princes (Prince
of Wales, Dukes of York, Cumberland, and Kent), and there was
no public opinion to check these vices.</p>

<p>The lawlessness that was abroad reached even to the young,
who disdained the control of their parents.</p></div>

<p>To the same effect writes Dr. Doran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Any one who will take the trouble to go carefully through the
columns of the ill-printed newspapers of the last century, will find
that drunkenness, dissoluteness, and the sword hanging on every
fool&rsquo;s thigh ready to do his bidding, were the characteristics of the
period. People got drunk at dinners, and then slew one another,
or in some other way broke the law.</p></div>

<p>The <i>taverns</i> were crowded with morning drinkers.
On the site occupied by the Bank of England, four inns
used to stand; one of them was called <i>The Crown</i>. Sir
John Hawkins, in his <i>History of Musick</i>, mentions that
it was not unusual to draw a butt (120 gallons) in half-pints
in the course of a single morning.</p>

<p>The drinking at the <i>Universities</i> was terrible.</p>

<p>Henry Gunning, M.A., Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge
(a descendant of the Bishop of Ely, who wrote the
prayer for the Church Militant), had great opportunities
of judging of the Cambridge of his day, for he was born
1768 in a Cambridgeshire vicarage, went up to Cambridge
at an early age, was made Esquire Bedell 1789,
and continued in that capacity till his death early in
1854. In his charming <i>Reminiscences of the University,
Town, and County of Cambridge, from the year 1780</i>, he
observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Drunkenness was the besetting sin of the period when I came
to college. I need scarcely add that many other vices followed in
its train.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, speaking of a college friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I do not remember ever to have seen him guilty of drunkenness,
<i>at that time almost universal</i>.</p></div>

<p>Again (pp. 147-148):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For many years during Rev. Charles Simeon&rsquo;s ministry (I
speak from my own personal knowledge) Trinity Church and the
streets leading to it were the scenes of the most disgraceful tumults.
On one occasion an undergraduate, who had been apprehended by
Simeon, was compelled to read a public apology in the church.
Mr. Simeon made a prefatory address: &lsquo;We have long borne during
public worship with the most indecent conduct from those whose
situation in life should have made them sensible of the heinousness
of such offences; we have seen persons coming into this place in a
state of intoxication; we have seen them walking about the aisles,
notwithstanding there are persons appointed to show them into
seats; we have seen them coming in and going out without the
slightest reverence or decorum; we have seen them insulting
modest persons, both in and after divine service; in short, the devotions
of the congregation have been disturbed by almost every
species of ill conduct.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>About 1788, Gunning was for some time a tutor in
Herefordshire; there he observed that immense quantities
of cider were drunk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In years when apples were abundant, the labourers in husbandry
were allowed to drink as much cider as they thought proper. It
was no unusual thing for a man to put his lips to a wooden bottle
containing four quarts, and not remove them until he had emptied
it. I have myself witnessed this exploit; but I never ventured to
mention a circumstance apparently so incredible, until I read
Marshall&rsquo;s <i>History of Herefordshire</i>, in which he relates the same
fact.</p></div>

<p>George Pryme (<i>b.</i> 1781, <i>obiit</i> 1868) in his <i>Autobiographic
Recollections</i>, 1870, fully confirms Gunning&rsquo;s picture
of Cambridge:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>When I first went to Cambridge [in 1799] the habit of hard
drinking was almost as prevalent there as it was in country
society....</p>

<p>&lsquo;Buzzing,&rsquo; unknown in the present day, was then universal.
When the decanter came round to any one, if it was nearly emptied,
the next in succession could require him to finish it; but if the
quantity left exceeded the bumper, the challenger was obliged to
drink the remainder and also a bumper out of the next fresh bottle.
There was throughout these parties an endeavour to make each
other drunk, and a pride in being able to resist the effects of the
wine.</p></div>

<p>This Pryme was a person of distinction; sometime
Fellow of Trinity, first Professor of Political Economy
in Cambridge University, and thrice M.P. for the Borough.
Moreover he was no teetotaller; though a moderate
man, he had full belief in the <i>medicinal</i> virtue of brandy.
And he had reason; for he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the winter of 1788-9 I was attacked by a severe fever, and
was attended by Dr. Storer of Nottingham, the most eminent
physician in that part of the country. After prescribing every
medicine that he could think of as suitable to the case, he called
one evening on my mother but declined seeing me, as he said
everything had been tried, and that giving more medicine was only
harassing me in vain. He however asked a few questions about
me, and was told that I had repeatedly begged for brandy. He
mixed some in a wine-glass with water, which I eagerly drank and
asked for more; he then mixed a second glass. The next forenoon
he called to inquire if I was still alive, and was told that I had had
a good night and was much better. He saw me, and from that
time I steadily recovered.</p></div>

<p>The habits of a University are very fair tests of the
habits of the more affluent, and upper middle classes
of the nation. Outside this for the most part is the
great class generally known as <i>tradesmen</i>. Probably
nothing has contributed so much to the deterioration of
this class, as the almost invariable habit of spending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
evening in some hotel or tavern. It is still common in
Germany. It is much to be hoped that it is dying out
in England. Charles Knight, in his <i>Passages of a Working
Life</i>, seems to speak of it as universally the case
early in the present century. He speaks of the tradesmen
as habitually</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sallying forth to spend their long evenings in their accustomed
chairs at the ale-house, which had become their second home.
Some had a notion that they secured custom to the shop by a constant
round among the numerous hostelries. I knew a most
worthy man, occupying a large house which his forefathers had
occupied from the time of Queen Anne, who, when he gave up the
business to his son, who, recently married, preferred his own fireside,
told the innovator that he would infallibly be ruined if he did not
go out to make friends over his evening glass.</p></div>

<p>But does not every grade in society sensibly or insensibly
take its cue from that <i>immediately</i> above it? And
what were those who should have set a virtuous example
doing? How much have such men to answer for, as
Byron, Porson, Pitt, Fox, Sheridan, Smart, Lamb, and
Churchill!</p>

<p>Of the first named, it has been observed that when
he was not impairing a naturally delicate constitution
with drastic medicines and protracted fasts, he would
sometimes eat and drink excessively. And this was
especially the case in fits of mortification. Everyone
will remember the circumstance of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
proscribing Byron&rsquo;s early production, <i>Hours of Idleness</i>.
Though he affected indifference, and spoke of the critique
as a paper bullet of the brain, yet he afterwards acknowledged
that he tried to drown his irritation on the day he
read it with three bottles of claret after dinner. His
excesses of all kinds, in his continental life, are matters
of history. They are usually considered to have contributed
to terminate his fever fatally. This recalls his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
clever lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>On a Carrier who died of Drunkenness.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">
John Adams lies here, of the parish of Southwell:<br />
A <i>carrier</i> who <i>carried</i> his can to his mouth well;<br />
He <i>carried</i> so much, and he <i>carried</i> so fast,<br />
He could <i>carry</i> no more, so was <i>carried</i> at last;<br />
For the liquor he drank being too much for one,<br />
He could not <i>carry</i> off, so he&rsquo;s now <i>carrion</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Charles Churchill, the author of the <i>Rosciad</i>, was a
sad drunkard. The caricature drawn of him by Hogarth
will be remembered. A number of them had met as
usual at their whist club in the <i>Bedford Arms</i> parlour.
There it was that Churchill insulted Hogarth, called him
a &lsquo;very shallow fellow,&rsquo; and afterwards in writing derided
the man, his productions, and his belongings. Hogarth
revenged the sneer. He converted an old copper-plate
into a palimpsest, on which he drew a caricature of
Churchill as a growling bear with the ragged canonicals
of a parson (for such the poet had been), a pot of porter
by his side, and a ragged staff in his paw, each knot
inscribed &lsquo;lye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Theodore Hook was a highly convivial man. In a
memoir of this once popular man, it is stated that the
disorder under which he long laboured arose from a
diseased state of the liver and stomach, brought on
partly by anxiety, but chiefly, it is to be feared, by that
habit of over indulgence at table, the curse of colonial
life. (At the instance of the Prince Regent he had
obtained a Government appointment in the Mauritius.)</p>

<p>A stanza of his own composition reveals in brief the
man:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquote">
Then now I&rsquo;m resolved at all sorrows to blink&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor ever let misery bore me.</span><br />

</p>

<p>The name of Charles Lamb will naturally suggest
itself. Of him one would fain observe silence in this
connection. He must at any rate speak for himself: &lsquo;A
small eater but not drinker.&rsquo; He acknowledges a partiality
for the production of the juniper. This would probably
prepossess Hazlitt, who observes in his <i>Thoughts and
Maxims</i>: &lsquo;We like a convivial character better than an
abstemious one, because the idea of conviviality in the
first instance is pleasanter than that of sobriety.&rsquo; Lamb
considered it a great qualification in his father that he
made punch better than any man of his degree in England.
C. Lamb was a schoolfellow of S. T. Coleridge,
and something more&mdash;a friend, not of a day, but of a
life. Severed during the University career of the Lake
poet, the friendship was maintained by occasional visits
of the latter to town, where at the <i>Salutation and Cat</i>, they
supped, heard the midnight chimes, and possibly heard
the clock strike one several times, in the little smoky
room now historical. More than twenty years passed,
and Lamb is found dedicating his works, then first collected,
to the same old friend. Meantime, countless
letters pass between them; on Lamb&rsquo;s part the lower
side of the convivial blending too freely with the literary.
Does he anticipate a visit to his friend? The joy is
infinitely heightened by the prospect of the tavern and
the &lsquo;egg-hot.&rsquo; Nor does he blush to confess &lsquo;I am writing
at random, and half tipsy.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>In his <i>The Old Familiar Faces</i>, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
I have been laughing, I have been carousing,<br />
Drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom-cronies,<br />
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.<br />
</p>

<p>Reference need not be made to that terribly tragical
dissertation in his incomparable <i>Essays of Elia</i>, entitled
<i>The Confessions of a Drunkard</i>. The passage which
begins: &lsquo;The waters have gone over me, but out of the
dark depths could I be heard, I would cry out to all
those who have set foot on that perilous flood,&rsquo; is familiar
to most lovers of literature. But whether the dismal
language is the mirror of his own experience, may remain
a moot point. However, facts contradict the assertion of
Barry Cornwall, that &lsquo;much injustice has been done to
Lamb, by accusing him of excess in drinking,&rsquo; and
Hazlitt was perfectly justified in unequivocally stating
what he had taken scrupulous pains to verify. Thus
much admitted, we may endorse the sentiment expressed
so feelingly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We admire his genius; we love the kind nature which appears
in all his writings; and we cherish his memory as much as if we
had known him personally.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p></div>

<p>From the social man of letters, we turn to one who
moved in a far wider circle; who, in Byron&rsquo;s opinion,
wrote the best comedy, the best opera, the best farce, the
best address, and delivered the very best oration ever
conceived or heard in this country&mdash;Richard Brinsley
Sheridan. He, like Lamb, can be judged out of his own
mouth. It was he who with piquant humour declared
that he could drink with advantage any <i>given</i> quantity of
wine. Wine, says his biographer, Tom Moore, was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>of his favourite helps to inspiration: &lsquo;If the thought
(he would say) is slow to come, a glass of good wine
encourages it, and when it <i>does</i> come, a glass of good
wine rewards it.&rsquo; To the same effect, Leigh Hunt remarks:
&lsquo;His table songs are always admirable. When
he was drinking wine he was thoroughly in earnest.&rsquo;
Lady Holland, at whose house Sheridan was a constant
guest, told Moore that he used to take a bottle of wine
and a book up to bed with him always; the <i>former</i> alone
intended for use. He took spirits with his morning tea
or coffee, and on his way from Holland House to town,
invariably stopped at the old roadside inn, the <i>Adam and
Eve</i>, where he ran up a long bill which Lord Holland
was left the privilege of paying.</p>

<p>In the very amusing and instructive <i>Reminiscences of
Captain Gronow</i>, speaking of Sheridan&rsquo;s prosperity, the
author urges:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Many of the follies and extravagances that marked the life of
this gifted but reckless personage must be attributed to the times in
which he existed. Drinking was the fashion of the day. The
Prince [Regent], Mr. Pitt, Dundas, the Lord Chancellor Eldon,
and many others who gave the tone to society, would, if they now
appeared at an evening party, &lsquo;as was their custom of an afternoon,&rsquo;
be pronounced fit for nothing but bed. A three-bottle man was not
an unusual guest at a fashionable table; and the night was invariably
spent in drinking bad port wine to an enormous extent.</p></div>

<p>The same writer observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Drinking and play were more universally indulged in then
[about 1814] than at the present time, and many men still living
must remember the couple of bottles of port at least which accomp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>anied
his dinner in those days.... The dinner-party, commencing
at seven or eight, frequently did not break up before one in the
morning. There were then four and even five-bottle men; and the
only thing that saved them was drinking very slowly, and out of
very small glasses. The learned head of the law, Lord Eldon, and
his brother Lord Stowell, used to say that they had drunk more bad
port than any two men in England; indeed, the former was rather
apt to be overtaken, and to speak occasionally somewhat thicker
than natural after long and heavy potations. The late Lords
Panmure, Dufferin, and Blayney, wonderful to relate, were six-bottle
men at this time; and I really think that if the good society
of 1815 could appear before their more moderate descendants, in
the state they were generally reduced to after dinner, the moderns
would pronounce their ancestors fit for nothing but bed.</p></div>

<p>Sheridan&rsquo;s success in life, as well as his attachment
to party, was mainly owing to his connection with one
of whom we shall next speak, viz. Charles James Fox.
A few months after his first appointment to office, Walpole
went to the House to hear the young orator, and he
tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Fox&rsquo;s abilities are amazing at so very early a period, especially
under the circumstances of such a dissolute life. He was just
arrived from Newmarket, had sat up drinking all night, and had
not been in bed.</p></div>

<p>More than once is he said to have taken his place in
the House of Commons in a state of absolute intoxication.</p>

<p>Mr. George Otto Trevelyan, M.P., gives in his <i>Early
History of Charles James Fox</i> a very bad picture of the
drinking habits of great men in England at that period.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>These were the days when the Duke of Grafton, the Premier,
lived openly with Miss Nancy Parsons. <i>Rigby</i>, the Paymaster of
the Forces, had only one merit, that he drank fair. He used
brandy as the rest of the world used small beer. <i>Lord Weymouth</i>,
grandson of Lord Cartaret, had more than his grandfather&rsquo;s capacity
for liquor, and a fair portion of his abilities. He co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>nstantly boozed
till daylight, even when a Secretary of State. His occasional
speeches were extolled by his admirers as preternaturally sagacious,
and his severest critics admitted them to be pithy. Walpole made
the following smart hit at him: &lsquo;If I paid nobody, and went drunk
to bed every morning at six, I might expect to be called out of bed
by two in the afternoon to save the nation, and govern the House
of Lords by two or three sentences as profound and short as the
proverbs of Solomon.&rsquo; &lsquo;They tell me, Sir John,&rsquo; said George the
Third to one of his favourites, &lsquo;that you love a glass of wine.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Those who have so informed your Majesty,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;have
done me great injustice; they should have said a bottle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Two of
the friends of Philip Francis, without any sense of having performed
an exceptional feat, finished between them a gallon and a
half of Champagne and Burgundy, a debauch which in this unheroic
age it almost makes one ill to read of.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The sobriety of Pitt has been the subject of much
debate. Mr. Jeaffreson has well said that free livers
delight to attribute their own failings to great people
who are free from them. Till Lord Stanhope relieved
Pitt&rsquo;s fame of groundless aspersions of intemperance, it
suffered from drunken epigrams, and the idle tales of
pot-loving detractors. Of the former, the following is a
specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
On folly every fool his talent tries;<br />
It needs some toil to imitate the wise;<br />
Though few like Fox can speak&mdash;like Pitt can think,<br />
Yet all like Fox can game&mdash;like Pitt can drink.<br />
</p>

<p>Perhaps no form of detraction is so insidious as
caricature, and Pitt was its sport. The pencil of
Gillray was busy in 1788 with a caricature entitled,
<i>Market Day&mdash;Every Man has His Price</i>. The Ministerial
supporters are represented as horned cattle
exposed for sale. The scene is laid in Smithfield. At
the window of a public-house adjoining appear Pitt and
Dundas, a jovial pair drinking and smoking.</p>

<p>Again, when the dearth of 1795 was just beginning,
a print by the same Gillray represents a convivi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>al scene
at Pitt&rsquo;s country house. It is entitled, &lsquo;<i>God save the
King! in a bumper; or, an Evening Scene three times a
Week at Wimbleton</i>.&rsquo; Pitt is trying to fill his glass from
the wrong end of the bottle, while his companion, grasping
pipe and bumper, ejaculates the words, &lsquo;Billy, my
boy&mdash;all my joy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still there is an element of truth underlying both
epigram and burlesque; but, having admitted this, we
may assert that his wont formed a contrast to the wild
habits of many of his contemporaries, and that with
justice he was favourably compared by the Court with
the irregularities of Fox and his associates.</p>

<p>Professor Richard Porson was at one time a prominent
figure in the <i>Cider Cellars</i> in Covent Garden. It
was his nightly haunt. It was there that one of his companions
is said to have shouted in his presence, &lsquo;Dick
can beat us all; he can drink all night and spout all
day.&rsquo; This sounds bad, but it must be remembered that
Porson had struggled long on the then miserable pittance
attached to the Greek Professorship at Cambridge,
40<i>l.</i> a year, and had suddenly obtained the post of head
librarian of the London Institution, with a salary increased
five-fold. He thus had facilities for indulgence,
and with them, possibly for a time, the appetite. An
<i>habitual</i> drunkard he was not. Like Johnson, he could
practise abstinence more easily than temperance. He
lived in days when the leading statesmen and politicians
were not ashamed of being seen under the influence of
wine, and though Porson has been vilified for his occasional
intemperance, it may, without much hesitation,
be affirmed that it was his reforming principles in
Church and State that brought much of the obloquy
upon him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>
<p>Thomson, the author of the <i>Seasons</i>, was a convivial
man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mrs. Hobart, Thomson&rsquo;s housekeeper, often wished Quin dead,
he made her master drink so. He and Quin used to come sometimes
from the Castle together at four o&rsquo;clock in a morning, and not
over sober you may be sure. When he was writing in his own
house he frequently sat with a bowl of punch before him, and that
a good large one too.</p></div>

<p>The following anecdote is told of him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. H. of Bangor said he was once asked to dinner by Thomson,
but could not attend. One of his friends who was there told him
that there was a general stipulation agreed on by the whole company,
that there should be no hard drinking. Thomson acquiesced,
only requiring that each man should drink his bottle. The terms
were accepted unconditionally, and when the cloth was removed a
three-quart bottle was set before each of his guests. Thomson had
much of this kind of agreeable humour.</p></div>

<p>His <i>Autumn</i> came out in 1730, in which occur the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But first the fuel&rsquo;d chimney blazes wide;<br />
The tankards foam; and the strong table groans<br />
Beneath the smoking sirloin, stretch&rsquo;d immense<br />
From side to side; in which with desperate knife<br />
The deep incision make, and talk the while<br />
Of England&rsquo;s glory, ne&rsquo;er to be defaced<br />
While hence they borrow vigour; or amain<br />
Into the pasty plunged at intervals,<br />
If stomach keen can intervals allow,<br />
Relating all the glories of the chace.<br />
Then sated Hunger bids his brother Thirst<br />
Produce the mighty bowl; the mighty bowl,<br />
Swell&rsquo;d high with fiery juice, steams liberal round<br />
A potent gale, delicious as the breath<br />
Of Mäia to the love-sick shepherdess<br />
On violets diffus&rsquo;d, while soft she hears<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>Her panting shepherd stealing to her arms.<br />
Nor wanting is the brown October, drawn<br />
Mature and perfect from his dark retreat<br />
Of thirty years; and now his honest front<br />
Flames in the light refulgent, not afraid<br />
Even with the vineyard&rsquo;s best produce to vie.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
At last these puling idlenesses laid<br />
Aside, frequent and full the dry divan<br />
Close in firm circle; and set ardent in<br />
For serious drinking. Nor evasion sly,<br />
Nor sober shift, is to the puking wretch<br />
Indulg&rsquo;d apart; but earnest brimming bowls<br />
Lave every soul, the table floating round,<br />
And pavement, faithless to the fuddled foot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Before their maudlin eyes</span><br />
Seen dim and blue the double tapers dance,<br />
Like the sun wading through the misty sky.<br />
Then sliding soft, they drop. Confus&rsquo;d above<br />
Glasses and bottles, pipes and gazeteers,<br />
As if the table even itself was drunk,<br />
Lie a wet broken scene; and wide below<br />
Is heap&rsquo;d the social slaughter: where astride<br />
The lubber Power in filthy triumph sits<br />
Slumbrous, inclining still from side to side,<br />
And steeps them drench&rsquo;d in potent sleep till morn.<br />
Perhaps some doctor, of tremendous paunch<br />
Awful and deep, a black abyss of drink,<br />
Outlives them all; and from his buried flock<br />
Retiring, full of rumination sad,<br />
Laments the weakness of these latter times.<br />
</p>

<p>In <i>Autumn</i>, somewhat later, he sings the praises of
<i>cider</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
The piercing cider for the thirsty tongue;<br />
Thy native theme and boon inspirer too,<br />
Phillips, Pomona&rsquo;s bard, the second thou<br />
Who nobly durst in rhyme-unfetter&rsquo;d verse<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>With British freedom sing the British song;<br />
How from Silurian vats high-sparkling wines<br />
Foam in transparent floods; some strong to cheer<br />
The wintry revels of the labouring hind;<br />
And tasteful some to cool the summer hours.<br />
</p>

<p>Again, we read a few lines later of the autumnal vintage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Round the raised nations pours the cup of joy:<br />
The claret smooth, red as the lip we press<br />
In sparkling fancy while we drain the bowl;<br />
The mellow-tasted Burgundy; and quick<br />
As is the wit it gives the gay champagne.<br />
</p>

<p>Wordsworth says of the <i>Seasons</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;Much of it is
written from himself.&rsquo; Probably this is true.</p>

<p>In 1798 was published a collection of the dramatic
works of John O&rsquo;Keefe. In the following lines from his
<i>Poor Soldier</i> occurs a phrase which has become household:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Dear Tom, this brown jug that now foams with mild ale,<br />
From which I now drink to sweet Nan of the Vale,<br />
Was once Toby Filpot&rsquo;s, a thirsty old soul<br />
As e&rsquo;er <i>cracked a bottle</i> or fathomed a bowl.<br />
</p>

<p>The allusion is simply to drunken frolics, during
which glass was broken. Mr. Oldbuck says in the
<i>Antiquary</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;We never were glass-breakers in this
house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1805 Robert Bloomfield published his rural poem,
the <i>Farmer&rsquo;s Boy</i>. It is a very humorous and suggestive
account of the manners of clod-hopping England
as engaged about the Harvest-home supper in Suffolk
and Norfolk, here entitled the <i>Horkey</i>. This has been
already discussed. Suffice it to add that Bloomfield&rsquo;s
charming little provincial ballad, entitled, <i>The Horkey</i>,
has been recently published by Macmillan, and is abundantly
illustrated.</p>

<p>But of all the marvellous issues from the press at
the beginning of the present century, nothing could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
more monstrous than the publication of a work entitled
&lsquo;<i>Ebrietatis Encomium; or, the Praise of Drunkenness</i>,
wherein is authentically and most evidently proved the
Necessity of Frequently Getting Drunk; and the Practise
is most ancient, primitive, and Catholick.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The author, not unnaturally, thinks that some
apology is needed in his preface. He declares that he
did not undertake the work on account of any zeal he
had for wine, but only to divert himself(!), and not to
lose a great many curious remarks he had made upon
this most Catholic liquid.</p>

<p>But we travel to far other soil.</p>

<p>The poet Cowper [<i>b.</i> 1781, <i>d.</i> 1800], the intellectual
ancestor of Wordsworth, has several pictures of his times
in his writings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>With a lofty and noble morality does he describe
the truly gay:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Whom call we gay? That honour has been long<br />
The boast of mere pretenders to the name.<br />
The innocent are gay&mdash;the lark is gay,<br />
That dries his feathers saturate with dew<br />
Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams<br />
Of dayspring overshoot his humble nest.<br />
The peasant too, a witness of his song,<br />
Himself a songster, is as gay as he.<br />
But save me from the gaiety of those<br />
Whose headaches nail them to a noon-day bed;<br />
And save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes<br />
Flash desperation, and betray their pangs<br />
For property stripp&rsquo;d off by cruel chance;<br />
From gaiety that fills the bones with pain,<br />
The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.<br />

<p>Noble lines these, breathing much of the spirit of

<p>There was not perhaps much need for our poet to

<p>Certainly not if the following picture was his usual
evening condition:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,<br />
Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,<br />
And, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn<br />

So let us welcome peaceful evening in.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;"><i>The Task</i>, Book IV., &lsquo;The Winter Evening.&rsquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Commenting upon the usual misquotation of this
passage, which provincial newspapers make a point of
rendering:&mdash;&lsquo;The cup that cheers&rsquo; &amp;c., Cuthbert Bede
adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The poet of &lsquo;The Task&rsquo; spoke of &lsquo;cups;&rsquo; and, it is very evident,
from the graphic description of the accompanying urn, that those
cups were intended to hold a certain beverage that had been introduced
into England about 130 years before &lsquo;The Task&rsquo; was written,
and which, by those who could afford to purchase it at the high
price then demanded for it, was known as &lsquo;Tea.&rsquo; It might be
urged, with more ingenuity than plausibility, that, as Cowper does
not mention the contents of the cups, they, together with the hot
water in the loud-hissing urn, might have been used for some of
those compounds, familiarly known as &lsquo;Cups.&rsquo; Thus, there were
&lsquo;cups&rsquo; of spiced wine, Claret, Burgundy, Gilliflower sack, Hydromel
(which was recommended by Lord Holles to those who abjured
wine, and was composed of honey, spring-water, and ginger), Cider,
and many kinds of ale and Beer-cups, distinguished by such extraordinary
names as Humpty-dumpty, Clamber-clown, Old Pharaoh,
Hugmatee, Stitchback, Cock-ale, Three-threads, Mum, and Knock-me-down,
which last name is particularly suggestive of the probable
result of the toper&rsquo;s indulgence in a brew of hot ale-cup, in which
gin was a leading ingredient.</p>

<p>It is very evident that it could only be a person who was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
hard-up for an argument, who could think of framing such an accusation
against the abstemious and gentle William Cowper, and who
could interpret his &lsquo;cups&rsquo; in any other sense than as cups for tea.
In fact, the whole passage presents to us a tea-table scene; and, as
we read it, we can see the comfortable parlour at Olney, the curtains
closely drawn&mdash;in that respect very sensibly differing from</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;The half-uncurtain&rsquo;d window,&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>mentioned in the winter-evening&rsquo;s scene, in Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pleasures
of Hope&rsquo;&mdash;with the bubbling urn, containing, possibly, the tea
already made, or else ready to contribute its boiling stream to the
tea-pot.</p></div>

<p>But this sort of evening was not the usual evening in
England in 1785. Much more frequently was the evening
spent in what our poet himself calls &lsquo;the quenchless
thirst of ruinous ebriety,&rsquo; and describes in the following
lines (<i>Task</i>, lib. iv.):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Pass where we may, through city or through town,<br />
Village or hamlet of this merry land,<br />
Though lean and beggar&rsquo;d, every twentieth pace<br />
Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff<br />
Of stale debauch, forth issuing from the styes<br />
That Law has licensed, as makes Temperance reel.<br />
There sit, involved and lost in curling clouds<br />
Of Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,<br />
The lackey, and the groom: the craftsman there<br />
Takes a Lethean leave of all his toil;<br />
Smith, cobbler, joiner, he that plies the shears,<br />
And he that kneads the dough; all aloud alike,<br />
All learned, and all drunk! the fiddle screams<br />
Plaintive and piteous, as it wept and wail&rsquo;d<br />
Its wasted tones and harmony unheard.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&lsquo;Tis here they learn</span><br />
The road that leads from competence and peace<br />
To indigence and rapine; till at last<br />
Society, grown weary of the load,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>Shakes her encumber&rsquo;d lap, and casts them out.<br />
But censure profits little: vain the attempt<br />
To advertise in verse a public pest<br />
That, like the filth with which the peasant feeds<br />
His hungry acres, stinks and is of use.<br />
The excise is fatten&rsquo;d with the rich result<br />
Of all this riot: and ten thousand casks<br />
For ever dribbling out their base contents,<br />
Touch&rsquo;d by the Midas finger of the State,<br />
Bleed gold for ministers to sport away.<br />
Drink and be mad then; &lsquo;tis your country bids!<br />
Gloriously drunk obey the important call!<br />
Her cause demands the assistance of your throats<br />
Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more.<br />
</p>

<p>Towards the end of the progress of error is the sage
advice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
With caution taste the sweet Circæan cup;<br />
He that sips often at last drinks it up.<br />
Habits are soon assumed, but when we strive<br />
To strip them off &lsquo;tis being flayed alive.<br />
Call&rsquo;d to the temple of impure delight<br />
He that abstains, and he alone, does right.<br />
</p>

<p>Finally, an admirable moral is contained in the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Pleasure admitted in undue degree<br />
Enslaves the will, nor leaves the judgment free.<br />
&lsquo;Tis not alone the grape&rsquo;s enticing juice<br />
Unnerves the moral powers, and mars their use;<br />
Ambition, avarice, and the lust of fame,<br />
And woman, lovely woman, does the same.<br />
</p>

<p>Wordsworth was a most abstemious man. He and
his wife drank water, and ate the simplest fare. When
Scott stayed with him at Rydal Mount, he had to hie him
to the nearest public-house not unfrequently.</p>

<p>Myers has observed, in his monograph on the poet
in <i>English Men of Letters</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The poet of the <i>Waggoner</i>&mdash;who, himself an habitual water-drinker,
has so glowingly described the glorification which the
prospect of nature receives in a half-intoxicated bra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>in&mdash;may justly
claim that he can enter into all genuine pleasures, even of an order
which he declines for himself. With anything that is false or
artificial he cannot sympathise, nor with such faults as baseness,
cruelty, rancour, which seem contrary to human nature itself; but
in dealing with faults of mere <i>weakness</i> he is far less strait-laced
than many less virtuous men.</p>

<p>His comment on Burns&rsquo; <i>Tam o&rsquo; Shanter</i> will perhaps surprise
some readers who are accustomed to think of him only in his
didactic attitude.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Wordsworth&rsquo;s Criticism.</i></p>

<p>... Who, but some impenetrable dunce or narrow-minded
puritan in works of art, ever read without delight the picture which
Burns has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer
Tam o&rsquo; Shanter? The poet fears not to tell the reader in the
outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard, whose
excesses were as frequent as his opportunities. This reprobate sits
down to his cups while the storm is roaring, and heaven and earth
are in confusion; the night is driven on by song and tumultuous
noise, laughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the
palate&mdash;conjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general
benevolence&mdash;selfishness is not absent, but wearing the mask of
social cordiality; and while these various elements of humanity
are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits,
the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off
the enjoyment within. I pity him who cannot perceive that in all
this, though there was no moral purpose, there is a moral effect.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,<br />
O&rsquo;er a&rsquo; the <i>ills</i> of life victorious.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>What a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for
the vicious habits of the principal actor in the scene, and of those
who resemble him! Men who to the rigidly virtuous are objects
almost of loathing, and whom therefore they cannot serve! The
poet, penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things,
has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and
feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so
much unhappiness to themselves, and to those whom it is their
duty to cherish; and, as far as he puts the reader into possession of
this intelligent sympathy, he qualifies him for exercising a salutary
influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved.</p></div>

<p>The poet Southey&rsquo;s opinion of the ale-house, <i>versus</i> th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>e
home, is as true of our own times as his own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For the labouring man the ale-house is too often a place of unmingled
evil; where, while he is single, he squanders the money
which ought to be laid up as a provision for marriage or old age;
and where, if he frequent it after he is married, he commits the far
heavier sin of spending, for his own selfish gratification, the earnings
upon which the woman and children whom he has rendered
dependent upon him have the strongest of all claims.</p></div>

<p>Of the drink itself he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
But Thalaba took not the draught,<br />
For right he knew the Prophet had forbidden<br />
That beverage, the mother of sins;<br />
Nor did the urgent guests<br />
Proffer the second time the liquid fire,<br />
For in the youth&rsquo;s strong eye they saw<br />
No movable resolve.<br />
</p>

<p>William Playfair, the famous political economist,
wrote in 1805 his <i>Enquiry into the Permanent Causes of
the Decline and Fall of Powerful and Wealthy Nations</i>.
He has some striking remarks upon the bearing of
<i>revenue</i> upon the drink traffic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When a nation becomes the slave of its revenue, and sacrifices
everything to that object, <i>abuses that favour revenue are difficult
to reform</i>; but surely it would be well to take some mode to
prevent the <i>facility with which people get drunk</i>, and the temptation
that is laid to do so. The immense number of public-houses,
and the way in which they give credit, are undoubtedly, in part,
causes of this evil. <i>It would be easy to lessen the number</i>, without
hurting liberty, and it would be no injustice if publicans were prevented
from legal recovery for beer or spirits consumed in their
houses, in the same manner that payment cannot be enforced of
any person under twenty-one years of age, unless for necessaries.
There could be no hardship in this, and it would produce a great
reform in the manners of the lower orders. There are only three
modes of teaching youth the way to well-doing&mdash;by precept, by
example, and by habit at an early age. Precept, without example
and habit, has but little weight, yet how can a child have either of
these, if the parents are encouraged and assisted in living a vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
life? Nations and individuals should guard against those vices to
which they find they have a natural disposition; and drinking and
gluttony are the vices to which the common people in this country
are the most addicted.</p></div>

<p>We now pass to some of the political action of the
reign. In 1768, Sir Francis Dashwood, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, proposed a new tax on cider and perry,
amounting to ten shillings on the hogshead. Earl
Stanhope states that the outcry was so vehement that a
modification of the scheme was all that was granted,
and four shillings were to be paid by the grower. In
the Upper House the Bill was also strongly opposed, but
the Ministry carried the point. Bute incurred much
odium. People compared the rash disregard of popular
opinion with which this measure was pushed through
with the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole, who had
bowed to the public demonstrations against his system
of excise; and when Bute&rsquo;s resignation was announced
many ascribed his retreat to the alarm raised by the
popular indignation. A caricature entitled, <i>The
Roasted Exciseman; or, the Jack Boot&rsquo;s exit</i>, represents
the enraged mob burning the effigy of a Scotchman suspended
on a gallows; a great worn boot lies on the bonfire,
into which a man is throwing an excised cider
barrel as fuel.</p>

<p>The City of London presented a petition against the
tax at the bar of the House of Commons, but to no
effect; and in the cider counties it was found hard
indeed to enforce the duties imposed.</p>

<p>One of many lachrymations was Benjamin Heath&rsquo;s
<i>The Case of the County of Devon</i>, 1763. An address to
honest English hearts, being an honest countryman&rsquo;s
reflections on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>the cider tax, 1763. Some plain reasons
for the repeal of the cider tax, dedicated to every man
who pays taxes, and particularly to the Honourable
G&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash;, M.P. for Norfolk, &amp;c., 1763. An address
to the electors, such as are not makers of cider and
perry, 1787.</p>

<p>The tax on beer, too, early in the reign, had greatly
exasperated the mob. The <i>Royal Magazine</i> tells that
while their Majesties were at Drury Lane Theatre, to see
the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, as Garrick was repeating the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;For you, my hearts of oak, for your regale,<br />
Here&rsquo;s good old English stingo, mild and stale,&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>a fellow cried out of the gallery: &lsquo;At threepence a pot,
Master Garrick, or confusion to the brewers!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Imposts on <i>malt</i> were continually brought forward.
The brewers as well as their clients were wild. Mr.
Whitbread inveighed on one occasion against the
Ministers for laying a <i>war tax</i> upon malt. Sheridan,
who was present, could not resist a shy at the brewer.
He wrote on a paper the following lines, and handed
them to Mr. Whitbread across the table:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
They&rsquo;ve raised the price of table drink;<br />
What is the reason, do you think?<br />
The tax on <i>malt</i>&rsquo;s the cause I hear&mdash;<br />
But what has <i>malt</i> to do with <i>beer</i>?<br />
</p>

<p>In 1791, the House of Commons was again induced
to consider the question, and a committee came to the
resolution: &lsquo;That the number of persons empowered to
retail spirits should be greatly diminished,&rsquo; &amp;c. Certain
Acts were passed, encouraging the rival trade of the
brewers. <i>Grocers were prohibited from selling drams in
their shops</i>, &amp;c. The Speaker of the House, in his
speech at the bar of the Lords, March, 1795, and in an
address delivered on presenting the Bills of Supply,
which received the unanimous thanks of the Lower
House, thus referred to the excellent result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> even these
small measures, and at the same time enunciated a pregnant
political truth. After alluding to the increased prosperity
and resources of the country, and to some measures
for decreasing the sale of spirits, he observes: &lsquo;Satisfied,
however, that those resources and that prosperity <i>cannot
be permanent without an effectual attention to the sobriety of
the people, their morals and peaceable subordination to the
laws</i>, they have, by an arrangement of duties which promises
also an increase of revenue, relieved the brewing
[trade] from all restriction of taxes, so as to give it a decided
advantage over the distilling, and thereby discourage the
too frequent and immoderate use of spirituous liquors, <i>a
measure which must conduce to sobriety, tranquillity, and content</i>,
and under which the people, encouraged in regular
industry, and the consequent acquisition of wealth, must
feel the blessings,&rsquo; &amp;c., of good government.</p>

<p>Under the dark days that followed, from 1795 to
1800&mdash;days of rebellion at home and revolution abroad&mdash;<i>this</i>
subject was lost sight of, unhappily for the interests
of all. The Acts which had initiated so much
good, were allowed to expire, discouragement to the use
of spirits ceased, grocers were again allowed to dispense
the drug to women and families, and debauchery rioted
and revelled as before.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>In 1796, among the next taxes introduced, was an
additional duty of twenty pounds per butt on wine.
Discontent ensued. Pitt&rsquo;s alleged propensity furnished
the material for satire. Gillray represented him under the
character of Bacchus, and his friend Dundas under that
of Silenus, in a caricature entitled <i>The Wine Duty, or
the Triumph of Bacchus and Silenus</i>. John Bull, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
empty bottle and empty purse, and with long face,
addresses his remonstrance: &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Bacchus, have
a bit of consideration for old John; you know as how
I&rsquo;ve emptied my purse already for you, and it&rsquo;s woundedly
hard to raise the price of a drop of comfort, now that one&rsquo;s
got no money left for to pay for it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Among the taxes of 1799 was one upon beer, which
would have the effect of raising the price of porter to
fourpence the pot, and which would most affect the working
classes. The Tory satirists pretended to sympathise
most with the Whig Dr. Parr, a great porter drinker.
Gillray published a sketch of the supposed <i>Effusions of a
Pot of Porter</i>, or &lsquo;ministerial conjurations for supporting
the war, as lately discovered by Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;r, in the froth
and fumes of his favourite beverage.&rsquo; A pot of four-penny
is placed on a stool, from the froth of which arises
Pitt, mounted on the white horse, brandishing a flaming
sword. The Doctor&rsquo;s reverie is a satire on the innumerable
mischiefs which popular clamour laid to the charge
of the Minister:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Fourpence a pot for porter! Mercy upon us! Ah! it&rsquo;s all
owing to the war, &amp;c. Have not they ruined the harvest? Have
not they blighted all the hops?</p></div>

<p>Wine was manufactured in England at this period.
Sir Richard Worsley tried the experiment of an <i>English
vineyard</i>. He planted the most hardy species of vine in
a rocky soil at St. Lawrence, Isle of Wight, and engaged
a French vine-dresser. He achieved a success, but only
temporary. He abandoned the project. A certain Mr.
Hamilton attempted the same at Painshill, on a soil of
gravelly sand. His first attempt at red wine failed. He
then turned his attention to white wine, in which he tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>Sir E. Barry, the experiment surpassed his most sanguine
expectations. Many good judges thought it better
than any champagne they had ever drunk. Such an
experience was certainly exceptional.</p>

<p>Faulkner (<i>Antiquities of Kensington</i>) quotes the following
memorandum from the MS. notes of Peter
Collinson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>October 18, 1765.</i>&mdash;I went to see Mr. Roger&rsquo;s vineyards at
Parson&rsquo;s Green [at Fulham], all of Burgundy grapes, and seemingly
all perfectly ripe; I did not see a green, half-ripe grape in all this
quantity. He does not expect to make less than fourteen hogsheads
of wine. The branches and fruit are remarkably large, and the
wine very strong.</p></div>

<p>George IV. was born in 1770, and came to the throne
in 1820. Intemperance, amidst other vices, was a feature
of his moral career. The surroundings of his birth
augured ill. Mrs. Draper, who attended the Queen with
her two first children, was dismissed from her duties in
consequence of her habitual inebriety. His proclivity
very nearly cost him dear while yet a youth. At a dinner
party at Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s house at Blackheath, the
whole company drank to excess, and betook themselves to
riotous frolic. One of the party let loose a big fierce dog,
which at once flew at one of the footmen, tore one of his
arms terribly, and nearly strangled a horse. The whole
party now formed themselves into a compact body and
assailed Towzer, who resolutely defended himself, and
had just caught hold of the skirts of the coat of his Royal
Highness, when one of the party by a blow on the head
felled the dog to the ground. In the confusion, however,
the Earl of Chesterfield fell down the steps leading to his
house, and severely injured the back of his head. The
Prince, who scarcely knew whether he had been fighting
a dog or a man, jumped into his phaeton, and there fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
asleep, leaving the reins to his uncle, the Duke of Cumberland,
who took him safely to town.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The Prince was a member of the Catch and Glee
Club at the Thatched House Tavern. He is (says Huish)
the reputed author of the second verse to the glee of the
<i>Happy Fellow</i>, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er,&rsquo; &amp;c.; and of the additional
verse to the song, &lsquo;By the gaily circling glass,&rsquo; which he
used to sing in his convivial moments with great effect.
Nothing more distinctly points to the ineradicable nature
of his diseased habit, than his conduct upon the arrival
of his bride-elect&mdash;Caroline of Brunswick. Lord Malmesbury,
the sole witness, tells the story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I ... introduced the Princess Caroline to him. She very
properly attempted to kneel to him. He raised her (gracefully
enough) and embraced her, said barely one word, turned round, retired
to a distant part of the apartment, and, calling me to him,
said: &lsquo;Harris, I am not well; pray get me a glass of brandy.&rsquo; I
said: &lsquo;Sir, had you not better have a glass of water?&rsquo; upon which
he, much out of humour, said with an oath: &lsquo;<i>No</i>; I will go directly
to the Queen.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The remark of the princess to Malmesbury, was: &lsquo;Mon
Dieu, est-ce que le Prince est toujours comme cela?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lord Holland has stated that at the wedding the
Prince had drunk so much brandy, that he could scarcely
be kept upright between two dukes. The reckless extravagance
of the Prince involved him in pecuniary
straights:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Not a farthing could be raised on the responsibility of any of his
immediate associates; the whole of the party were actually in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>state of the deepest poverty; and Major Hanger, in the history of
his life, mentions a circumstance in which he, Sheridan, Fox, <i>an
illustrious individual</i>, and a Mr. Berkeley, repaired to a celebrated
tavern then known by the name of the Staffordshire Arms, where
after carousing with some dashing Cyprians who were sent for on
the occasion, the combined resources of the whole of the party
could not defray the expenses of the evening. On this occasion,
Sheridan got so intoxicated that he was put to bed, and on awakening
in the morning, he found himself in the character of a hostage
for the expenses of the previous night&rsquo;s debauch.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p></div>

<p>It must, however, be admitted, that when once upon
the throne, he had the rare capability of uniting dignity
with hilarity. An incident in connection with a public
<i>toast</i> is worthy of narration. When the King visited
Scotland, a banquet was given by the Lord Provost of
Edinburgh in the Parliament House. The King, in
returning thanks for the reception given him, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I take this opportunity, my Lords and Gentlemen, of proposing
the health of the Lord Provost, <i>Sir</i> William Arbuthnot, <i>Baronet</i>,
and the Corporation of Edinburgh.</p></div>

<p>Thus did the King confer the baronetcy upon the president.
A complication of disease terminated his reign
in 1880.</p>

<p>The Public-house Regulation Act of 1758 was in force
till 1828, when a consolidating Act was passed, with an
appeal to justices in quarter sessions.</p>

<p>Its chief provisions are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Licences to be granted <i>only from year to year</i>, at a special
session of magistrates; with power of applicant to appeal to the
quarter sessions in case of refusal of licence: and the refusing
justices not to vote there.</p>

<p>2. Applicants for licence to affix notice of their intention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>applying, on the door of the house, and of the church of the parish
in which it is situated, for three prior Sundays, and serve a copy on
one of the overseers and one of the peace officers.</p>

<p>3. In case of actual or apprehended tumult, two justices may
direct the publican to close his house: disobedience to be esteemed
as disorder.</p>

<p>4. The licence stipulates that the publican shall not adulterate
his liquors, <i>or allow drunkenness, gaming, or disorder</i>; that he
shall not suffer persons of notoriously bad character to assemble
therein; and that he shall not, <i>save to travellers</i>, open his house
during Divine Service on Sundays and holy-days.</p>

<p>5. Heavy and increasing penalties for repeated offences against
the terms and tenor of the licence; magistrates at sessions being
empowered to punish an alehouse-keeper, convicted by a jury of a
third offence, by a fine of 100<i>l.</i>, or to adjudge the licence to be
forfeited.</p></div>

<p>The Distillery Act of 1825 requires notice.</p>

<p>By the enactment of 1825, no person can obtain a
<i>licence</i> for conducting a distillery, unless he occupies a
tenement of the value of 20<i>l.</i> a year, pays parish rates,
and resides within a quarter of a mile of a market town
containing 500 inhabited houses. Before obtaining a
licence, the amount of which is 10<i>l.</i>, he must lodge with
the collector, or other officer of excise, an entry or registry
of his premises, the several apartments and utensils,
specifying the contents of the vessels and the purposes
for which they are intended; and every such room and
utensil must be properly labelled with its appropriate
name and object. With the registry must be delivered
a drawing, or description of the construction, use, and
course of every fixed pipe in the distillery, as well as of
all casks and communications therewith connected.
Pipes for the conveyance of worts or wash must be
painted red, those for low wines or feints, blue; those
for spirits, white; for water, black. No still can be
licensed of a less content than 400 gallons, nor can the
distiller make spirits at the same time from different
materials. The distiller must give notice of the gravity
at which he intends to make his wort. These are specimens
only of the conditions imposed. Before this enactment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
distillation was confined to a few capitalists; but,
with a view of encouraging a fair competition in the
trade, and inducing the people to take the spirits directly
from the distillers, the Act was passed.</p>

<p>The drink temperature was maintained throughout
all classes of society. Charles Knight gives an apt
description of a Christmas in London in 1824:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The out-door aspects of London enjoyment at Christmas were
not unobserved by me. Honestly to speak, it was a dismal spectacle.
In every broad thoroughfare, and in every close alley, there
was drunkenness abroad; not shamefaced drunkenness, creeping in
maudlin helplessness to its home by the side of the scolding wife,
but rampant, insolent, outrageous drunkenness. No decent woman
even in broad daylight could at the holiday seasons dare to walk
alone in the Strand or Pall Mall.</p></div>

<p>The stronger spirituous liquors were all the rage; and it
was under the impression that by making beer, &amp;c.,
more readily accessible, there would be less demand for
the fire-water, that the Beerhouse Act was passed, of
which we shall soon speak. But before doing so, let us
recall the names of one or two who ranged themselves
on the side of temperance.</p>

<p>James Montgomery writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Many might be profited by the resolute perusal of the &lsquo;Confessions
of an Opium Eater&rsquo; with self-application, for every habitual
indulgence of appetite beyond what nature requires or will endure
for the health of body or mind is a species of opium-eating. Such
cordials, exhilaratives, and stimulants are generally, in the first
instance, resorted to as lenitives of pain, reliefs from languor, or resources
in idleness; they soon become necessary gratifications,
affording little either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> pleasure or of pain in the use (though non-indulgence
is misery) till in the sequel they grow into tyrannous
excesses that exhaust the animal spirits, debilitate the mind, and
consume the frame with disease which no medicine can reach. The
drunkard in this sense is an opium-eater; he puts an &lsquo;enemy into
his mouth that steals away his senses,&rsquo; and the fool&rsquo;s paradise, into
which liquor transports him, lies on &lsquo;the broad way that leadeth
to destruction.&rsquo; The snuff taker and the tobacco smoker in this
sense are opium-eaters; these luxuries, as well as eating and drinking,
may be enjoyed in moderation, but where does moderation end
and abuse begin? That fine line of distinction was never yet
traced with assurance, and the only safety lies many a league on
the right side of it. The Indian weed may be less promptly deleterious
than the Asiatic, but in this country it is scarcely a question
that the former destroys more victims than the latter.</p></div>

<p>Sydney Smith writes thus to Lady Holland, in
1828:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Many thanks for your kind anxiety respecting my health. I not
only was never better, but never half so well; indeed, I find I have
been very ill all my life, without knowing it. Let me state some of
the goods arising from abstaining from all fermented liquors.
First, sweet sleep; having never known what sweet sleep was, I
sleep like a baby or a plough-boy. If I wake, no needless terrors, no
black visions of life, but pleasing hopes and pleasing recollections:
Holland House, past and to come! If I dream, it is not of lions
and tigers, but of Easter dues and tithes. Secondly, I can take
longer walks, and make greater exertions, without fatigue. My
understanding is improved, and I comprehend political economy,
I see better without wine and spectacles than when I used both.
Only one evil ensues from it: I am in such extravagant spirits that
I must lose blood, or look out for some one who will bore or depress
me. Pray leave off wine:&mdash;the stomach is quite at rest; no heartburn,
no pain, no distention.</p></div>

<p>In 1824 Carolina Nairne, <i>née</i> Carolina Oliphant, became
Baroness Nairne, her husband, Major Nairne, being
restored to a barony granted to his family in the time of
Charles I.</p>

<p>She appears to be the first writer of a thorough teetotal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>

<p>King William IV. (1830-1837) rigidly practised temperance.
Indeed he zealously promoted it before his
accession to the throne. One incident may serve as an
illustration. On the death of the keeper of Bushy Park,
the King, then Duke of Clarence, appointed the keeper&rsquo;s
son to succeed him. This young man broke his leg, a
circumstance which elicited the practical sympathy of
the Duke. After his recovery, the young man took to
drinking; so the Duke, in order to cure him of the propensity,
required his attendance every night at eight
o&rsquo;clock, and if he appeared in liquor reprimanded him
the following morning. But all to no purpose. The infatuated
keeper died from the effects of intemperance.</p>

<p>The King however was fond of giving <i>toasts</i> after
dinner, when his prosy speeches were notorious.</p>

<p>The following specimen of toasts at a public banquet
is taken from that given on the occasion of the opening
of London Bridge.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As soon as the royal visitors had concluded their repast, the
Lord Mayor rose, and said: &lsquo;His most gracious Majesty has condescended
to permit me to propose a toast. I therefore do myself
the high honour to propose that we drink His Most Gracious
Majesty&rsquo;s Health, with four times four.&rsquo;
The company rose, and, after cheering him in the most enthusiastic
manner, sang the national anthem of &lsquo;God save the King.&rsquo;
His Majesty bowed to all around, and appeared to be much
pleased.</p>

<p>Alderman Sir Claudius Hunter then rose, and said: &lsquo;I am
honoured with the permission of his Majesty to propose a toast. I
therefore beg all his good subjects here assembled to rise, and to
drink that &lsquo;Health and every Blessing may attend Her Majesty the
Queen.&rsquo;&rsquo; Which was accordingly done, with the utmost enthusiasm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
<p>The Lord Mayor then presented a gold cup, of great beauty, to
the King, who said, taking the cup: &lsquo;I cannot but refer, on this
occasion, to the great work which has been accomplished by the
citizens of London. The City of London has been renowned for its
magnificent improvements, and we are now commemorating a most
extraordinary instance of their skill and talent. I shall propose the
source from whence this vast improvement sprung, &lsquo;The Trade and
Commerce of the City of London.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King then drank what is called the &lsquo;loving cup,&rsquo; of which
every other member of the Royal Family present most cordially
partook.</p>

<p>His Majesty next drank the health of the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress, for which his lordship, in a few words, expressive of the
deepest gratitude, thanked his Majesty. The chief magistrate soon
after was created a Baronet.</p></div>

<p>Prominent amongst the legislative beacons of the
present century is the famous <i>Beer Act</i> of 1830. Spirit
drinking was terrible; a remedy was sought; the expedient
adopted was the Beer Act.</p>

<p>At the Middlesex Sessions, held on Thursday, January
21, 1830, Mr. Serjeant Bell alluded to the increase
of the consumption of gin as a dreadful and horrible
evil. A year ago there were 825 inmates in the Middlesex
Pauper Hospital, but now the number was between
1,100 and 1,200, the increase being mainly attributable
to the practice of gin drinking. Sir George Hampson
said that the gin-shops were now decorated and fitted up
with small private doors, through which women of the
middle, and even above the middle classes of society,
were not ashamed to enter, and take their dram, when
they found they could do so unobserved. Sir Richard
Birnie bore testimony to the dreadful prevalence of drunkenness
in the Metropolis: <i>there were 72 cases brought to
Bow Street on the Monday previous</i>, for absolute and
beastly drunkenness, and what was worse, <i>mostly women,
who had been picked up in the streets</i>, where they had
fallen dead drunk: but while he deplored the enormity
of the evil, he declared that it was difficult to fi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>nd any
remedy for it.</p>

<p>Hoping to do good by substituting beer for spirits,
an Act was passed in the 1st Will. IV., &lsquo;to permit the
general sale of beer and cider by retail in England.&rsquo;
The following are its main provisions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. That any <i>householder</i> desirous of selling malt-liquor, by
retail, in any house, may obtain an excise licence on payment of
two guineas, and for cider only, on paying one guinea.</p>

<p>2. That a list of such licences shall be kept at the Excise office,
open to the inspection of the magistrates.</p>

<p>3. That the applicant must give a bond, and find surety for the
payment of penalties incurred.</p>

<p>4. Penalty for vending wine and spirits, 20<i>l.</i></p>

<p>5. In case of riot, magistrates can command the closing of the
houses.</p>

<p>6. Penalties for disorderly conducting of the house.</p>

<p>7. Not to open before four <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and to close at ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and
during Divine Service on Sundays and holy-days.</p></div>

<p>How did it work? How did it operate upon the consumption
(1) of beer, (2) of spirits? During the ten
years preceding the passing of the Beerhouse Act, the
quantity of malt used for brewing was 268,139,389
bushels: during the ten years immediately succeeding,
the quantity was 344,143,550 bushels, showing an
increase of 28 per cent. During the ten years 1821-1830,
the quantity of British spirits consumed was 57,970,963
gallons, and during the next ten years it rose to 76,797,365
gallons, an increase of 32 per cent. All this clearly
proved that the increased facilities for getting beer
created a greater demand for spirits. During the year
following the Act, more than 30,000 beer-shops were
opened in England and Wales. In Sheffield, as one instance,
300 beer-shops were added to the old complement
of public-houses; and it is especially to be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>ed
that before the second year had transpired, 110 of the
keepers of these houses had applied for <i>spirit</i> licences to
satisfy the desire for ardent drinks.</p>

<p>On the motion of the Marquis of Chandos, April 18,
1833, it was ordered in the House of Commons &lsquo;That a
select committee be appointed to inquire into the state
and management of houses in which beer is sold by retail
under the Act 1st Will. IV., cap. 64, commonly called
beer-shops, and with a view to making such alterations
in the law as may tend to their better regulation, and to
report their observations, together with their opinion
thereon.&rsquo; Thirty-two members were appointed as the
committee, and April 22, ten others were added to it.
The committee sat April 24, 26, 30, May 1, 3, 7, 8, 10,
14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24. The witnesses examined
were in number 59, among whom were A. Magendie,
late Assistant Poor Law Commissioner: A. Crowley
(brewer of Alton), magistrates, magistrates&rsquo; clerks, beer-sellers,
farmers and others. The Marquis of Chandos
presided at most of the sittings of the committee. The
committee&rsquo;s report, dated June 21, 1833, contains fifteen
resolutions, of which the first was:&mdash;&lsquo;That it is the
opinion of the committee from the evidence that has
been adduced that considerable evils have arisen from
the present management and conduct of beer-houses.&rsquo;
The other resolutions expressed the committee&rsquo;s opinion
that every applicant should produce a certificate of good
character signed by six rated inhabitants of the parish
or township (not beer-sellers)&mdash;the certificate to be signed
by the overseer or assistant overseer, as a proof that the
six persons named were rated inhabitants; that, besides
other penalties, magistrates should be able on a second
conviction to suspend licences for two years or les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>s&mdash;a
third offence to involve a disqualification for three years;
that beer-houses should be closed till half-past twelve on
Sunday, that the hours of keeping open at night should
be extended in towns and restricted in country districts;
and in the last resolution the committee &lsquo;suggest the
revisal of the system under which all beer and spirit
shops are licensed, and (without expressing a decisive
opinion on this extensive subject) your committee feel
that very serious reasons of justice and public advantage
may be adduced in favour of the assimilation of all
the regulations as to hours and management to which
every description of house licensed to sell beer or spirituous
liquors by retail should be subjected.&rsquo; No legislation
was superinduced upon this report.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>In 1834 Mr. Buckingham moved &lsquo;that a select committee
be appointed to inquire into the extent, causes,
and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication
among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom, in
order to ascertain whether any legislative measures can
be devised to prevent the further spread of so great a
national evil.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This committee, composed of some of the most eminent
members of the House, including the late Sir Robert
Peel, sat for upwards of twenty-one days receiving evidence.
The official report tendered a number of recommendations
for repressing the manufacture, importation,
and sale of alcoholic liquors, showing that this national
disease of drunkenness stood in need of sharp and speedy
remedies; and that the administration of these remedies
was clearly within the province of the Legislature.</p>

<p>The report is much too long for transcription; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the principles they lay down are worthy of all acceptation.</p>

<p>(1) That the <i>right</i> of legislative interference for the
correction of any evil which affects the public weal, cannot
be questioned.</p>

<p>(2) That the <i>power</i> to apply correction by legislative
means cannot be doubted, without supposing the better
portion of the community unable to control the excesses
of the ignorant and disorderly, which would be to declare
our incapacity to maintain the first principles of government
by ensuring the public safety.</p>

<p>(3) That the <i>sound policy</i> of applying legislative power
to direct, restrain, or punish the vicious propensities of
the evil disposed, cannot be disputed, without invalidating
the right of government to protect the innocent
from the violence of the guilty, which would in effect
declare all government to be useless; an admission that
would undermine the very first principles of society.</p>

<p>Then follow what they propose as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Immediate Remedies, Legislative and Moral.</i></p>

<p>The separation of the houses in which intoxicating drinks are
sold in four distinct classes. (1) Houses for the sale of beer only&mdash;not
to be consumed on the premises. (2) Houses for the sale of
beer only&mdash;to be consumed on the premises, and in which refreshments
of food may also be obtained. (3) Houses for the sale of
spirits only&mdash;not to be consumed on the premises. (4) Houses for
the accommodation of strangers and travellers, where bed and
board may be obtained, and in which spirits, wine, and beer may
all be sold.</p>

<p>The limiting the number of such houses, of each class, in proportion
to population in towns, and to distances and population in
country districts: the licences for each to be annual, and granted
by magistrates and municipal authorities rather than by the excise;
to be chargeable with larger sums annually than are now <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>paid for
them, especially for the sale of spirits; and the keepers of such
houses to be subject to progressively increasing fines for disorderly
conduct, and forfeiture of licence and closing up of the houses for
repeated offences.</p>

<p>The closing of all such houses at earlier hours than at present,
and for the most part uniformly with each other. The first and
second classes of houses, in which beer only is sold, to be closed on
Sunday, except for one hour, afternoon and evening; the third
class of houses, where spirits only are sold, to be entirely closed all
Sunday; and the fourth class, as inns or hotels, to be closed to all
visitors that day, save only travellers and inmates.</p>

<p>The making all retail spirit-shops as open to public view as
provision shops.</p>

<p>The refusal of retail spirit licences to all but those who would
engage to confine themselves exclusively to dealing in that article:
and consequently the <i>entire separation</i> of the retail sale of spirits
<i>from groceries</i>, provisions, wine or beer, except only in inns.</p>

<p>The discontinuance of all issues of ardent spirits (except medicinal)
to the navy and army, &amp;c., and the substitution of articles of wholesome
nutriment. The abolition of all garrison and barrack canteens,
and the substitution of some other and better mode of filling up the
leisure of men confined within military forts and lines: the opinions
of most of the military officers examined on this point by your
Committee being that the drinking in such canteens is the most
fertile source of all insubordination, crime, and consequent punishment
inflicted on the men.</p>

<p>The withholding from the ships employed in the merchant
service the drawback granted to them on foreign spirits, by which
they are now enabled to ship their supplies of that article at a reduced
scale of duty, and are thus induced to take on board a greater
quantity than is necessary, to the increased danger of the property
embarked, and to the injury of the crew.
The prohibition of the practice of paying the wages of workmen at
public-houses, or any other place where intoxicating drinks are sold.</p>

<p>The providing for the payment of such wages to every individual
his exact amount, except when combined in families: so as to
render it unnecessary for men to frequent the public-houses, and
spend a portion of their earnings to obtain change.</p>

<p>The payment of wages at or before the breakfast hour in the
mornings of the principal market-day in each town, to enable the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>wives or other providers of workmen to lay out their earnings in
necessary provisions at an early period of the market, instead of
risking its dissipation at night in the public-house.</p>

<p>The prohibition of the meetings of all friendly societies, sick
clubs, money clubs, masonic lodges, or any other permanent associations
of mutual benefit and relief at public-houses, or places where
intoxicating drinks are sold; as such institutions, when not formed
expressly for the benefit of such public-houses, and when they are
<i>bonâ fide</i> associations of mutual help in the time of need, can, with
far more economy and much greater efficacy, rent and occupy for
their periodical meetings equally appropriate rooms in other places.</p>

<p>The establishment, by the joint aid of the Government and the
local authorities and residents on the spot, of public walks, and
gardens, or open spaces for athletic and healthy exercises in the
open air, in the immediate vicinity of every town, of an extent, and
character adapted to its population; and of district and parish
libraries, museums, and reading rooms, accessible at the lowest rate
of charge; so as to admit of one or the other being visited in any
weather, and at any time; with the rigid exclusion of all intoxicating
drinks of every kind from all such places, whether in the open air
or closed.</p>

<p>The reduction of the duty on tea, coffee, and sugar, and all the
healthy and unintoxicating articles of drink in ordinary use; so as
to place within the reach of all classes the least injurious beverages
on much cheaper terms than the most destructive.</p>

<p>The encouragement of Temperance Societies in every town and
village of the kingdom, the only bond of association being a voluntary
engagement to abstain from the use of ardent spirits as a
customary drink, and to discourage, by precept and example, all
habits of intemperance in themselves and others.</p>

<p>The diffusion of sound information as to the extensive evils produced
to individuals and to the State, by the use of any beverage
that destroys the health, cripples the industry, and poisons the
morals of its victims.</p>

<p>The institution of every subordinate auxiliary means of promoting
the reformation of all such usages, courtesies, habits and
customs of the people, as lead to intemperate habits; more especially
the exclusion of ardent spirits from all places where large numbers
are congregated either for business or pleasure, and the changing
the current opinion of such spirits being wholesome and beneficial
(which the frequent practice of our offering them to those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>whom we
wish to please or reward so constantly fosters and prolongs) into
the opinion of their being a most pernicious evil, which should on
all occasions be avoided, as poisoner of the health, the morals, and
the peace of society.</p>

<p>The removal of all taxes on knowledge, and the extending every
facility to the widest spread of useful information to the humblest
classes of the community.</p>

<p>A national system of education, which should ensure the means
of instruction to all ranks and classes of the people, and which, in
addition to the various branches of requisite and appropriate knowledge,
should embrace, as an essential part of the instruction given
by it to every child in the kingdom, accurate information as to the
poisonous and invariably deleterious nature of ardent spirits, as an
article of diet, in any form or shape; and the inculcation of a sense
of shame at the crime of voluntarily destroying, or thoughtlessly
obscuring that faculty of reasoning, and that consciousness of
responsibility, which chiefly distinguish man from the brute, and
which his Almighty Maker, when He created him in His own image,
implanted in the human race to cultivate, to improve, and to refine&mdash;and
not to corrupt, to brutalise, and to destroy.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Ultimate or Prospective Remedies.</i></p>

<p>The ultimate or prospective remedies which have
been strongly urged by several witnesses, and which
<i>they</i> think, when public opinion shall be sufficiently
awakened to the great national importance of the subject,
may be safely recommended, include the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The absolute prohibition of the importation from any foreign
country, or from our colonies, of distilled spirits in any shape.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The equally absolute prohibition of all distillation of ardent
spirits from grain.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The restriction of distillation from other materials, to the
purposes of the arts, manufactures, and medicine, and the confining
the wholesale and retail dealing in such articles to chemists,
druggists, and dispensaries alone.</p></div>

<p>Finally they conclude:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As your Committee are fully aware that one of the most
important elements in successful legislation is the obtaining the
full sanction and support of public opinion in favour of the laws&mdash;and
as this is most powerful and most enduring when based on
careful investigation and accurate knowledge as the result, they
venture still further to recommend the most extensive circulation
during the recess, under the direct sanction of the Legislature, of
an abstract of the evidence obtained by this inquiry, in a cheap and
portable volume, as was done with the Poor Law Report, to which
it would form the best auxiliary; the national cost of intoxication
and its consequences being tenfold greater in amount than that of
the poor-rates, and pauperism itself being indeed chiefly caused by
habits of intemperance, of which it is but one out of many
melancholy and fatal results.</p></div>

<p>By 4th and 5th William IV., the preamble whereof recites
<i>that much evil had arisen from the management of
houses in which</i> beer <i>and</i> cider <i>are sold</i>, it was enacted
that each beer-seller is to obtain his annual excise
licence <i>only on condition</i> of placing in the hands of the
excise, <i>a certificate of good character signed by six rated
inhabitants of his parish</i> (none of whom must be brewers
or maltsters), if in a town of 5,000 inhabitants; but
the house to be one rated at 10<i>l.</i> a year. This Act also
distinguishes between persons who sell liquor <i>to be drunk
on the premises</i>, and those who sell it only to be drunk
elsewhere. By a Treasury order, beer sold at, or under,
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per quart, may be retailed without licence.</p>

<p>It is well known that Lord Brougham was a warm
advocate of the Beer Act in the first instance. He entirely
changed his opinion. In 1839, he said in the
Upper House:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To what good was it that the Legislature should pass laws to
punish crime, or that their lordships should occupy themselves in
finding out modes of improving the morals of the people by giving
them education? What could be the use of sowin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>g a little seed
here, and plucking up a weed there, if these beer-shops were to be
continued that they might go on to sow the seeds of immorality
broadcast over the land, germinating the most frightful produce
that had ever been allowed to grow up in a civilised country, and,
he was ashamed to add, under the fostering care of Parliament, and
throwing its baleful influences over the whole community?</p></div>

<p>Queen Victoria had scarcely ascended the throne before
she was reminded that the evils of the drink traffic
were upmost in the minds of many of her Majesty&rsquo;s
subjects. At a Conference held at Carnarvon, August 2,
1837, a congratulatory address to the Sovereign upon
her accession was drawn up. It stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To this declaration not less than one hundred thousand of your
Majesty&rsquo;s loyal subjects have already subscribed their names, some
thousands of whom had previously been drunkards. And could we
convey to your royal mind the incalculable benefits resulting from
the simple means of total abstinence from intoxicating liquor, we
would with humble confidence earnestly entreat your Majesty to
condescend to patronise our endeavour to wipe away from Britain
the plague-spot of drunkenness.</p></div>

<p>In the treatment of this period, we have to confront
an apparent anomaly, viz. the largest drink bills on record,
and the most strenuous efforts to get rid of drink
altogether. That the Statute Book bristles with legislative
interference, is sufficiently accounted for by these
two circumstances. In no period has legislation been to
the same extent an index of the precise situation. Let
us at once address ourselves to its salient features.</p>

<p>By the 2nd and 3rd Victoria, called the <i>Metropolitan
Police Act</i>, operating within a circle of fifteen
miles from Charing Cross, all public-houses are to be
shut on Sundays until one o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, <i>except for
travellers</i>: and publicans are <i>prohibited</i>, under penalties
of 20<i>l.</i>, 40<i>l.</i>, and 50<i>l.</i>, for the first, second, and third offences,
<i>from selling spirits to young persons under sixteen
years of age</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>By the 3rd and 4th Victoria a licence can only
be granted to the <i>real</i> occupier of the house; and the
rated value to be 15<i>l.</i> in towns of 10,000 inhabitants;
11<i>l.</i> in towns of between 2,500 and 10,000; and 8<i>l.</i> in
smaller places. The hours for opening and closing within
the metropolitan boroughs are 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and 12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>;
but 11 o&rsquo;clock in any place within the bills of mortality,
or any city, town, or place not containing above 2,500
inhabitants. In smaller places 10 o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> On any
Sunday, Good Friday, or Christmas Day, or any day
appointed for a public fast or thanksgiving, the houses
are not to be opened before one o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Licensed
victuallers and keepers of beer-shops who sell ale <i>to be
drunk on the premises</i>, may have soldiers billeted on
them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On June 15, 1849, a Select Committee of the Lords, on the
motion of the Earl of Harrowby, who became its chairman, was
appointed &lsquo;to consider the operations of the Acts for the sale of beer,
and to report thereon to the House.&rsquo; The Committee held sittings
June 25, 28, July 5, 12, 13, and 20. Next session it was reappointed,
and took evidence February 28, March 5 and 19; and
the report agreed upon bears date May 3, 1850. Fifteen witnesses
were examined in the first session, and ten in the second session.
The Committee&rsquo;s report refers to the evidence and petitions which
had come before them, and then proceeds: &lsquo;On a review of all the
statements and opinions which have thus been brought before them,
the Committee have no hesitation in stating that the expectations
of those who proposed the existing system have not been realised.
Their object appears to have been to create a class of houses of refreshment,
respectable in character, brewing their own beer,
diminishing by the supply of a cheap and wholesome beverage the
consumption of ardent spirits, and thus contributing to the happiness
and comforts of the labouring classes. But it appears that of these
houses only one-twelfth brew their own beer; that a very large proportion
are, as in the case of public-houses, the actual property of
brewers, or tied by advances to them; that they are notorious for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
the sale of an inferior article; that the consumption of ardent spirits
has, from whatever cause, far from diminished; and that the
comforts and morals of the poor have been seriously impaired. It
was already sufficiently notorious that drunkenness is the main
cause of crime, disorder, and distress in England, and it appears
that the multiplication of houses for the consumption of intoxicating
liquors, which under the Beer Act has risen from 88,930 to 123,396,
has been thus in itself an evil of the first magnitude, not only by
increasing the temptations to excess, which are thus presented at
every step, but by driving houses, even those under the direct
control of the magistrates, as well as others originally respectable,
to practices for the purpose of attracting custom which are degrading
to their character, and most injurious to morality and disorder.&rsquo;
The increase of crime is next adverted to, and the defects of the
system pointed out, such as an &lsquo;unlimited multiplication&rsquo; of the
worst class of beer-houses, the want of security as to character, the
low rating, the opening of beer-houses in obscure localities&mdash;&lsquo;But,
perhaps, the evil of all the most difficult to deal with is the absence
of all control save by legal conviction almost impracticable to
attain.&rsquo; &lsquo;The magnitude of these evils has led to a widely-extended
feeling in favour of an abandonment of that part of the existing law
by which consumption on the premises is permitted. But the
existence of houses conducted under a beer licence with propriety
and advantage, and the length of time which this system has already
endured, have made the Committee unwilling to contemplate a
change so extensive until experience shall have proved that it is
impossible by other means to abate the evil.&rsquo; The suggestions of
the Select Committee were to the effect that all beer and coffee-shops
should be open to the visits of the police; that new applicants for a
beer licence should be compelled to procure certificates from the
magistrates in Petty Sessions that they were satisfied as to the
rating and character of the applicant; that the rating should be in
places with less than 2,500 population, 10<i>l.</i>; under 10,000, 15<i>l.</i>;
above 10,000, 20<i>l.</i> (the rating required by the existing law being,
severally, 8<i>l.</i>, 11<i>l.</i>, and 15<i>l.</i>); that applicants should give one
month&rsquo;s notice, the notice to be affixed for three weeks to some
public place, before the Petty Sessions, at which three out of six of
the certifiers to character should attend with the overseers of the
respective parishes, rate-book in hand; no magistrate&rsquo;s certificate
to be granted to any person convicted of misdemeanour or who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
had forfeited a spirit licence; no person licensed to sell beer for
consumption on the premises to sell any other article except refreshments
and tobacco; that debts for intoxicating liquors drunk on the
premises not to be recoverable by law.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1853, a Select Committee of the House of Commons
was appointed to examine into the system under which
public-houses, &amp;c., are regulated, with a view of reporting
whether any alteration of the law can be made for
the better preservation of the public morals, the protection
of the revenue, and for the proper accommodation of
the public; which sat for 41 days, examining witnesses
and considering evidence, under the able presidency of
the Right Hon. C. P. Villiers (§ 29). The report and
evidence, now published, form two ponderous Blue-books
of 1,174 folio pages. The chief points of the <i>Report from
the Select Committee on Public-houses</i>, July 1854, are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The distinctions as to licences lead to evasion of the law.</p>

<p>2. The distinction between beer-shops and public-houses give
rise to unhealthy competition, under which both parties are drawn
to <i>extreme expedients for the attraction of custom</i>. Mr. Stanton,
a publican, says:&mdash;&lsquo;There is a great deal of gambling carried on in
Birmingham, although the police do all they can to put it down.
If the licensed victuallers did not allow it, the parties would go to
a beer-house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>3. <i>Beer is seldom at the public-house what it was at the
brewery.</i> A late partner in one of the metropolitan breweries
says:&mdash;&lsquo;It is quite notorious if you drink beer at the brewery, and
at a public-house a little way off, you find it a very different
commodity&rsquo; (4538).</p>

<p>4. The drinks are <i>adulterated</i>, as well as diluted. Mr. Ridley,
who has under his management certain offices for the analysation
of alcoholic liquors, states that there are several <i>recipes</i>, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>&lsquo;To a barrel of porter [add] 12 gallons of liquor, 4 lbs. of foots, 1 lb.
of salt; and sometimes to bring a head up [and lay it down?], a
little <i>vitriol</i>, <i>cocculus indicus</i>, also a variety of things very minute&rsquo;
(4700). Mr. J. W. McCulloch, analytic chemist, in 40 samples of
brewers&rsquo; beer, found 10&frac12; gallons proof spirit to every 100 gallons,
but at several of the licensed victuallers supplied by those brewers
it did not reach 7; and out of 150 samples there was not one within
20 per cent. of the brewery standard.</p>

<p>5. That magistrates do not enforce the law, or very rarely.</p>

<p>6. &lsquo;<i>The beer-shop system has proved a failure.</i> It was
established under the belief that it would give the public their beer
cheap and pure; would dissociate beer-drinking from drunkenness,
and lead to the establishment, throughout the country, of a class of
houses of refreshment, altogether free from the disorders <i>supposed</i>
to attend <i>exclusively</i> on the sale of spirits.&rsquo;</p>

<p>7. The Committee concur in the statement of the Lords&rsquo; Report
on the Sale of Beer Act, that &lsquo;It was already sufficiently notorious
<i>that drunkenness is the main cause of crime, disorder, and distress
in England</i>; and it appears that the multiplication of houses for
the consumption of intoxicating liquors, under the Beer Act, has
risen from 88,930 to 123,306.&rsquo;</p>

<p>8. That throughout the country &lsquo;the publicans are completely
under the thumb of the brewers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>9. The trade of a publican is looked upon as a <i>peculiar privilege</i>.
The hope of obtaining a licence increases beer-shops.</p>

<p>10. It seems desirable that a higher rate of duty be paid for a
licence, and more stringent regulations enforced as to character and
sureties.</p>

<p>11. Statistics of intemperance defective. The evidence before
the Committee is sufficient to show that the amount of drunkenness
is very much greater than appears upon the face of any official
returns.</p>

<p>12. There are many places where beer is sold without a licence.
Some of them, under cover of the law permitting beer at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a
quart to be sold without licence, sell also porter and ale (6882). &lsquo;At
the single town of Fazeley there are about 30 houses that sell
porter, ale, and beer indiscriminately; they are private houses,
known as &ldquo;Bush-houses,&rdquo; from their having a bush over the door
as a sign to their frequenters&rsquo; (4838, 6840). At Oldham &lsquo;there are
from 400 to 500 such places, known there as <i>Hush-shops</i>, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>they brew their own beer, and have each their own known customers.&rsquo;
At Bolton, at Preston, and in Hampshire and London,
similar practices are more or less prevalent (3664, 3679).</p>

<p>13. &lsquo;The <i>temptation</i> is strong to encourage intemperance, <i>and
a vast number of the houses for the sale of intoxicating drinks
live upon drunkards and the sure progress of multitudes to
drunkenness</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>14. &lsquo;Your Committee do not feel it <i>necessary</i> to follow the
evidence upon the connection of intoxicating drinks with crime; it
has, directly or indirectly, been the subject of inquiry at different
times, and has been reported upon by numerous committees of
your Honourable House, who bear <i>unvarying testimony</i> both to the
general intemperance of criminals, <i>and the increase and diminution
of crime in direct ratio with the increased or diminished consumption
of intoxicating drinks</i>.... The entire evidence tends to
establish that it is <i>essential</i> that the sale of intoxicating drinks shall
be under strict supervision and control.&rsquo;</p>

<p>15. &lsquo;The testimony is <i>universal</i> that the greatest amount of
drinking takes place on Saturday night, and during the hours that
the houses are allowed by law to be open on Sunday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>16. &lsquo;It need not be matter of surprise that in view of the vast
mass of evils found in connection with intemperance, it should have
been suggested altogether to <i>prohibit</i> the manufacture and sale of
intoxicating drinks. Laws to that effect are in force in the States
of Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Michigan, in
the United States; and your Committee have had before them
several zealous promoters of an Association established to procure
the enactment of similar laws in England.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p></div>

<p>On July 13, 1854, Colonel Wilson Patten strove to
give effect to the provisions of the Villiers Committee.
His Bill, known as the &lsquo;Sunday Beer Act,&rsquo; was &lsquo;A Bill
for further regulating the sale of beer and other liquors
on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This Act closed public-houses and beer-shops on <i>Sunday</i>,
from half-past two o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> until six <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and
from ten o&rsquo;clock on Sunday evening until four <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on
Monday. During the few months of its operating, t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>here
was a sensible abatement of drunkenness and disorder,
as is testified by the returns from the police, throughout
the country. We cite places by way of specimen. <i>Warrington</i>:
&lsquo;A most remarkable difference is observable in
the general order which prevails throughout the town,
as well as by the discontinuance of fearful affrays, and
riotous conduct.&rsquo; <i>Liverpool</i>: &lsquo;The new Act,&rsquo; says Mr.
Greig, head constable of the police, &lsquo;has been attended
with the most beneficial results.&rsquo; <i>London</i>: Mr. G.
A&rsquo;Beckett, magistrate of the Southwark Police Court, in a
letter to the <i>Times</i>, Jan. 8, 1855, says, &lsquo;that on the
Monday mornings before the Act, the business of the
court was greater than on any other days, but that
since, it had only averaged two cases of drunkenness
for each Sunday.&rsquo; In 1855, the Wilson Patten Act was
superseded by the New Beer Bill of Mr. Henry Berkeley,
which extended the hour of closing to eleven at night,
and gave a little more freedom to the traffic on the
Sunday afternoon. The history of this remarkable
piece of legislation is worth preserving, as a monument
of its author&rsquo;s&mdash;character. In a speech delivered by
him, at the second anniversary dinner of the Licensed
Victuallers&rsquo; Association, Bristol, reported in the <i>Bristol
Mercury</i>, of Nov. 4, 1854, he said, that after Wilson
Patten&rsquo;s Bill had passed the second reading, he had
been waited on by a deputation, but that being the
&lsquo;eleventh hour,&rsquo; no successful opposition could then be
offered. He believed the words he used to the deputation
were, &lsquo;If nobody else comes forward I will have a
<i>shy</i> at it.&rsquo; This it will be seen, was just <i>before</i> the Bill
became law, and, therefore, <i>before</i> it had gone into effect.
Mr. Berkeley opposed it without trial, and stood pledged
against it without regard to its results. On Feb. 20,
1855, immediately after the meeting of Parliament, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>Mr.
Berkeley, in his place in Parliament, inquired of the
Government, whether they intended to do anything in
reference to the Act, and received a reply that it was
not their intention to repeal it. Mr. Berkeley then
recommended the appointment of a select committee.
This created considerable division among the publicans,
who held many meetings for discussion, at all of which
Mr. Berkeley was recognised as &lsquo;<i>their</i> experienced and
talented <i>adviser</i>.&rsquo; (See the <i>Daily News</i>, April and May,
1855, and <i>The Era</i> of April 22.) On April 23 a meeting
of delegates is reported, in <i>The Era</i> of the 29th,
to have been held in Mr. Painter&rsquo;s public-house, Bridge
Street, Westminster, which resulted in the appointment
of a deputation to <i>consult</i> with Mr. Berkeley. The deputation
is reported to have waited on Mr. Berkeley
in the lobby of the House of Commons. &lsquo;A long desultory
conversation ensued, after which Mr. Berkeley
advised the delegates to confer among themselves, and to
consider well the course which would be most beneficial
for them to pursue. <i>He would postpone for a week his
motion for a Select Committee....</i> Eventually his advice
was accepted, and on June 26, 1855, his motion for
a Select Committee was agreed to by the House&mdash;Mr.
Cobbett, the seconder, remarking that no legislation
could be attempted that session.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>In 1860, Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s <i>Wine Licences Act</i> was passed.
This measure permitted foreign wines to be sold for consumption
on the premises to various classes of refreshment
houses. It gave concurrent power to grocers, &amp;c.,
to sell those wines in bottles for consumption off the premises.
The introducer of this measure, then Chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
of the Exchequer, stated that the proposal was not intended
merely as a means of raising revenue, but as one
carrying out the principles of free trade, and contributing
to the comforts and conveniences of the people.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The following statistics have been carefully gathered by
Mr. Samuelson, from which some estimate may be formed
of the effect produced by this legislation of Mr. Gladstone:&mdash;Beginning
with the year 1859, the wine imported
from France was 695,911 gallons; from Spain
and Portugal, 4,893,916 gallons; whilst in 1876 the
wine imported from France was 6,745,710 gallons, and
from Spain and Portugal, 10,186,332 gallons. The
importation of strong wines had therefore actually fallen
below the average of 1863-65, whilst that of French
wine had increased tenfold by the reduction of the
duty.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>In 1863, Mr. J. Somes introduced into Parliament
his <i>Sunday Closing Bill</i>, which proposed to prohibit the
sale of intoxicating liquors, except to <i>bonâ fide</i> travellers,
from eleven o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night to six o&rsquo;clock
Monday morning. The Bill was rejected.</p>

<p>In March 1864, Sir W. Lawson introduced into the
House his <i>Permissive Bill</i>; which provides that on application
of any district, the votes of the ratepayers shall be
taken as to whether the traffic shall exist in that district
or not; a majority of two-thirds of the ratepayers being
necessary to decide the question. This Bill was the embodiment
of the principles of the &lsquo;United Kingdom
Alliance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1868, the Bill of Mr. John Abel Smith was rejected;
which, while prohibiting Sunday drinking on the premises,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>allowed four hours for the sale of dinner and supper beer.</p>

<p>In 1869, the Government adopted the Bill of Sir H.
Selwyn-Ibbetson, entitled <i>The Wine and Beerhouse Act</i>,
which transferred the power of licensing beer-houses from
the excise to the magistracy, who now could exercise
over all applications for new beer and wine licences the
same discretionary control, as in the case of spirit
licences. By this measure the number of such houses
was limited. But the 50,000 existing houses, with the
exception of a few denounced dens, were perpetuated&mdash;a
new monopoly and with it a new vested interest was
created, and a point of reform was reached much below
that for which the public opinion of the country was
prepared.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>In 1869, Mr. Peter Rylands moved for the adoption
of his Resolution,&mdash;&lsquo;That in the opinion of this House it
is expedient that any measure for the general amendment
of the laws for licensing public-houses, beer-houses, and
refreshment houses, should include the prohibition of
the sale of liquors on Sunday.&rsquo; This fell through. But
in 1871, the same member succeeded in getting read a
second time a much modified Bill, which was, however,
negatived when it came on for Committee.</p>

<p>In 1871, Lord Aberdare (then Mr. Bruce), the Home
Secretary, introduced a Bill on behalf of the Government,
with the professed object of reforming the laws relating
to the licensing of the sale of intoxicating liquors. He
denounced, in his introductory speech, the existing laws
as seriously defective, and tending to undermine the best
interests of the community. The Bill was thorough,
honest, and calculated in ten years to have changed the
face of the community, by its many provisions calculated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>to restrain the traffic as well as the hours of sale, week
day and Sunday.</p>

<p>Amongst its wisest provisions was the appointment
of inspectors of the trade. But a panic set in, and Mr.
Bruce was obliged to withdraw, and a suspensory measure
preventing the issue of any fresh licences for the
next year, was introduced by Sir R. Anstruther, and became
law. In two years, however, it was succeeded by
an amended Bill, which rendered its chief provisions
practically null.</p>

<p>In 1872, Mr. Hugh Birley introduced his Sunday
Closing Bill into the House. But it got no further than
its first reading.</p>

<p>In 1876, Mr. Joseph Cowen&rsquo;s Bill for the establishment
of licensing boards was thrown out.</p>

<p>In 1877, Mr. Chamberlain introduced a motion for
the adoption of the &lsquo;Gothenburg System,&rsquo; the main
principle of which is, that municipal corporations
should have power to buy up and become owners of
public-house licences, their agents to have no personal
or pecuniary interest in the profits, but rather be encouraged
to push the sale of food and non-intoxicants, and
all profits derived from the sale of intoxicating liquors
be devoted to the relief of the rates, &amp;c. The motion
was rejected.</p>

<p>In 1876 &lsquo;The Lords&rsquo; Committee on Intemperance&rsquo;
was appointed, on the motion of Dr. Tait, Archbishop of
Canterbury, &lsquo;for the purpose of inquiring into the prevalence
of habits of intemperance, and into the manner
in which these habits have been affected by recent legislation
and other causes.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>In 1877-78, the committee, not having as yet acted,
was reappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>ed. One hundred witnesses were examined,
including members of Parliament, magistrates,
clergymen, constables, municipal authorities, doctors,
merchants, &amp;c. In their bulky report, issued in 1879,
they recommend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. That legislative facilities should be afforded for the local
adoption of the Gothenburg and Chamberlain schemes, or of some
modification of them.</p>

<p>2. That renewals of beer-house licences before 1879 should be
placed on the same footing as those of public-houses.</p>

<p>3. That in cases of decisions affecting the renewal of licences in
boroughs having separate quarter sessions, the appeal shall be to
the Recorder, where there is one, and not to the county justices.</p>

<p>4. That justices should be authorised to refuse transfers on the
same grounds of misconduct as those on which renewals of licences
are now refused.</p>

<p>5. That no removal of a licence from house to house should be
sanctioned without allowing the inhabitants of the interested
locality the opportunity of expressing their objections.</p>

<p>6. A considerable increase in licence duties.</p>

<p>7. Licensed houses outside the metropolis, not to open before
7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and be closed earlier than at present.</p>

<p>8. That licensed houses in Scotland and Ireland be closed one
hour earlier than at present on week-days.</p>

<p>9. That on Sundays, licensed houses in the metropolis should
be open from <i>one</i> to <i>three</i> <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> for consumption off the premises,
and for consumption on, from <i>seven</i> to <i>eleven</i> <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> In other places
from 12.30 to 2.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> for consumption off, and for consumption on
the premises from 7 to 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> in populous places, and from 7 to 9
in others.</p>

<p>10. Even if a person, professing to be a <i>bonâ fide</i> traveller, has
on the previous night lodged outside the 3-mile limit, as defined by
the Act, it still rests with the magistrates to determine whether he
be a <i>bonâ fide</i> traveller or not.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>

<p>11. That justices should have discretionary power of licensing
music-halls and dancing saloons in the country as at present in
the metropolis, whether connected with public-houses or not, and
that all such places should be subject to supervision by the police.</p>

<p>12. That certain serious offences should entail the compulsory
endorsement of the licence, and that the treating of constables
should be added to the list of offences included in the category.</p>

<p>13. That any person &lsquo;having or keeping for sale&rsquo; any intoxicating
liquors without a licence, should be liable to penalties of the same
description and amount as those under the existing law &lsquo;for selling
or exposing for sale,&rsquo; and that the powers of apprehension upon
warrant in cases of illicit drinking should be generally applied.</p>

<p>14. That the entering of liquors under some other name upon the
bill of a shopkeeper holding a licence to sell off the premises should
be an offence against the licence punishable by immediate forfeiture.</p>

<p>15. That a list of convictions kept by the justices&rsquo; clerks should
be legal evidence of previous convictions.</p>

<p>16. That all occasional licences to sell elsewhere than on
licensed premises should be granted by two justices at quarter
sessions.</p>

<p>17. That fines and penalties should apply in Scotland as in
England.</p>

<p>18. That the &lsquo;Grocers&rsquo; Licence&rsquo; recommendation of the Royal
Commission of 1877 should be adopted in Ireland.</p>

<p>19. That in Ireland and Scotland, as in England, no spirits
should be sold to children under sixteen.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1879, Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s Habitual Drunkards Bill
became law.</p>

<p>In the same year, Mr. Stevenson introduced the English
Sunday Closing Bill, which met with a by no means
unfavourable reception, though it was not at present
carried. The following year he moved again in the
same direction. Mr. Pease carried an amendment to
this which provided for off sale during limited hours in
the country, and for such modified sale in the metropolitan
districts as would satisfy the wish of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1880, Sir Wilfrid Lawson carried his &lsquo;Local Option&rsquo;
resolution, by a majority of twenty-six. This was
another form of the original &lsquo;Permissive Bill.&rsquo; All
detail is here omitted. It affirms the justice of local
communities being entrusted with the power to protect
themselves from the operation of the liquor traffic.</p>

<p>In June, 1881, the same baronet moved: &lsquo;That in
the opinion of this House, it is desirable to give legislative
effect to the resolution passed on June 18, 1880.&rsquo;
This was carried by a majority of forty-two.</p>

<p>Earl Stanhope&rsquo;s Bill for preventing payment of
wages in public-houses has passed the Upper House.</p>

<p>An important scheme of amendment of the licensing
laws was put forward by the &lsquo;Committee on Intemperance
for the Lower House of Convocation of the Province
of Canterbury.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Convinced that without an improved and stringent system of
legislation, and its strict enforcement, no effectual and permanent
remedy for intemperance can be looked for, they urge as</p>

<p class="center"><i>Legislative Remedies</i></p>

<p>1. The repeal of the Beer Act of 1830, and the total suppression
of beer-houses throughout the country.</p>

<p>2. The closing of public-houses on Sunday, <i>bonâ fide</i> travellers
excepted.</p>

<p>3. The earlier closing of public-houses on week-days, especially
on Saturday.</p>

<p>4. A great reduction in the number of public-houses throughout
the kingdom; it being in evidence that in proportion as facilities
for drinking are reduced, intemperance is restrained.</p>

<p>5. Placing the whole licensing system under one authority.</p>

<p>6. The rigid enforcement of the penalties now attached to
drunkenness, both on the actual offenders and on licensed persons
who allow drunkenness to occur on their premises.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>

<p>7. Passing an Act to prevent the same person holding a music,
dancing, or billiard licence, in conjunction with a drink licence.</p>

<p>8. Prohibiting the use of public-houses as committee rooms at
elections, and closing such houses on the days of nomination and
election in every Parliamentary borough.</p>

<p>9. The appointment of a distinct class of police for the inspection
of public-houses, and frequent visitation of publics for the
detection of adulterations, to be followed, on conviction, with
severe penalties.</p>

<p>10. The repeal of all the duties on tea, coffee, chocolate, and
sugar.</p>

<p>11. Your Committee, in conclusion, are of opinion that as the
ancient and avowed object of licensing the sale of intoxicating
liquors is to supply a supposed public want, without detriment to
the public welfare, a legal power of restraining the issue or renewal
of licences should be placed in the hands of the persons most
deeply interested and affected&mdash;namely, the inhabitants themselves&mdash;who
are entitled to protection from the injurious consequences
of the present system. Such a power would, in effect, secure to the
districts, willing to exercise it, the advantages now enjoyed by the
numerous parishes in the Province of Canterbury, where, according
to reports furnished to your Committee, owing to the influence of
the landowner, no sale of intoxicating liquors is licensed.</p></div>

<p>Few, it may be believed, are cognisant of the fact
that there are at this time within the Province of Canterbury,
more than one thousand parishes in which there
is neither public-house nor beer-shop; and where, in
consequence of the absence of these inducements to
crime and pauperism, the intelligence, morality and
comfort of the people are such as the friends of temperance
would have anticipated.</p>

<p>The non-legislative recommendations urge the removal
of benefit clubs from taverns, the discontinuance
of wage-payment in them, and the providing of ample
and varied counter-attractions.</p>

<p>Thus much for legislation, and for the impulses that
stimulate thereunto. Much has been written both for
and against restriction. Violently opposed to it was Mr.
John Stuart Mill, who m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>ay well claim to be the mouthpiece
of the adversaries of prohibition. Speaking on
the laws against intemperance in his <i>Essay on Liberty</i>,
he remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Under the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one
English colony, and of nearly half the United States, have been
interdicted by law from making any use whatever of fermented
drinks, except for medical purposes; for prohibition of their sale is,
in fact, as it is intended to be, prohibition of their use. And though
the impracticability of executing the law has caused its repeal in
several of the states which had adopted it, including the one from
which it derives its name, an attempt has notwithstanding been
commenced, and is prosecuted with considerable zeal by many of
the professed philanthropists, to agitate for a similar law in this
country. The association, or &lsquo;Alliance,&rsquo; as it terms itself, which
has been formed for this purpose, has acquired some notoriety
through the publicity given to a correspondence between its
secretary and one of the very few English public men who hold
that a politician&rsquo;s opinions ought to be founded on principles. Lord
Stanley&rsquo;s share in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen
the hopes already built on him, by those who know how rare such
qualities as are manifested in some of his public appearances, unhappily
are among those who figure in political life. The organ of
the Alliance, who would &lsquo;deeply deplore the recognition of any
principle which could be wrested to justify bigotry and persecution,&rsquo;
undertakes to point out the &lsquo;broad and impassable barrier&rsquo; which
divides such principles from those of the association. &lsquo;All matters
relating to thought, opinion, conscience, appear to me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;to
be without the sphere of legislation; all pertaining to social act,
habit, relation, subject only to a discretionary power vested in the
state itself, and not in the individual to be within it.&rsquo; No mention
is made of a third class, different from either of these&mdash;namely,
acts and habits which are not social, but individual&mdash;although it is
to this class, surely, that the act of drinking fermented liquors
belongs. Selling fermented liquors, however, is trading, and trading
is a social act. But the infringement complained of is not on the
liberty of the seller, but on that of the buyer and consumer; since
the state might just as well forbid him to drink wine, as purposely
make it impossible for him to obtain it. The secretary, however,
says: &lsquo;I claim, as a citizen, a right to legislate whenever my socia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>l
rights are invaded by the social act of another.&rsquo; And now for the
definition of these &lsquo;social rights.&rsquo; &lsquo;If anything invades my social
rights, certainly the traffic in strong drink does. It destroys my
primary right of security, by constantly creating and stimulating
social disorder. It invades my right of equality, by deriving a profit
from the creation of a misery I am taxed to support. It impedes
my right to free moral and intellectual development, by surrounding
my path with dangers, and by weakening and demoralising society
from which I have a right to claim mutual aid and intercourse.&rsquo;
A theory of &lsquo;social rights,&rsquo; the like of which probably never before
found its way into distinct language; being nothing short of this,
that it is the absolute social right of every individual, that every
other individual shall act in every respect exactly as he ought;
that whosoever fails thereof in the smallest particular, violates my
social right, and entitles me to demand from the legislature the
removal of the grievance. So monstrous a principle is far more
dangerous than any single interference with liberty; there is no
violation of liberty which it would not justify; it acknowledges no
right to any freedom whatever, except, perhaps, to that of holding
opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them; for the moment,
an opinion, which I consider noxious, passes any one&rsquo;s lips, it
invades all the &lsquo;social rights&rsquo; attributed to me by the Alliance.
The doctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each
other&rsquo;s moral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be
defined by each claimant according to his own standard.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, from another point of
view, and looking at the probable effects of restraint,
makes the following remarkable observation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Obedience to his genius is a man&rsquo;s only liberating influence.
We wish to escape from subjection, and a sense of inferiority&mdash;and
we make self-denying ordinances, we drink water, we eat grass, we
refuse the laws, we go to jail: it is all in vain; only by obedience
to his genius, only by the freest activity in the way constitutional
to him, does an angel seem to arise before a man, and lead him by
the hand out of all the wards of the prison.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p></div>

<p>And it was from deep conviction, and not as a flippant
apophthegm, that Bishop Magee pronounced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
he preferred to see England free, to England sober.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Augustus Sala, a man of ample observation
and reflection, thought otherwise. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We drink the very strongest liquors that can be brewed or distilled;
the classes among us who are not decent are in the habit of
getting mad drunk, and of fighting, after the manner of wild beasts
when they have a chance of using their fists, their feet, or their
teeth on each other, or on the guardians of the law. Our places of
licensed victualling are merely ugly dens, where the largest number
of sots can get tipsy in the shortest space of time; and Sunday in
London with all the public-houses, all the music halls thrown
unrestrictedly open from morning till night would exhibit the most
horrible terrestrial <i>inferno</i> that eye ever beheld, that the ear ever
heard, or the heart ever sickened at. We are so very strong and
stalwart, and earnest, and English, in a word, that we need in our
diversions a number of restrictive check and kicking-straps, which
the feebler and less pugnacious people of the Continent do not
require.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p></div>

<p>He felt that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Law does not put the least restraint<br />
Upon our freedom, but maintains it:<br />
Or, if it does, &lsquo;tis for our good<br />
To give us freer latitude<br />
For wholesome laws preserve us free<br />
By stinting of our liberty.<br />
</p>

<p>Or, as it has been admirably expressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are wheels within wheels, and there are liberties within
liberties; and what we contend for in respect to liberty is this, that
we are preaching against a liberty which is created, and for a
liberty which is eternal.</p></div>

<p>At any rate, as long as it can be proved that drunkenness
prevails in any sense in the direct ratio of the
facilities for obtaining drink, so long must the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>of those facilities remain upon the legislative agenda.</p>

<p>The problem is: can you separate the facilities for
getting drink from those of getting drunken. For the
man who can solve this problem, a niche in the temple
of fame remains unfilled.</p>

<p>There are plenty who are ready to exclaim that the
causes of excess are easy to define. They would tell us that
it arises from an unholy alliance between human nature
and artificial stimulant. And they would glibly argue&mdash;take
away the man from the drink, or the drink from the
man, and excess is at an end. But one of these factors,
human nature, declines the divorce. Still, however,
there remains a sphere for legislative and philanthropic
effort. There may be a loosing of the bands of this too
often unholy alliance. You may get rid of many predisposing
causes.</p>

<p>One of these, and a powerful one, is <i>ignorance</i>, and
that of many kinds. Mr. Buckle remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The most active cause of crime is drunkenness, and this is
caused partly by misery, partly by ignorance, which makes men
think it a <i>remedy</i>, and partly by a want of intellectual occupation....
Drunkenness caused by an <i>ignorant</i> belief that without spirits
and beer, strength to work cannot be kept up.... The greater the
amount of misery and depression, the greater the amount of
drunkenness.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p></div>

<p>M. Compte thought that drunkenness is promoted
by an <i>ignorance of its results</i>: and there is an element
of truth here. How many vainly look to it to drive
away remorse, care, and sorrow; thus, Horace (i. 18):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Neque</span><br />
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>Liebig, in his <i>Letters on Chemistry</i>, says that it is the
effect of <i>poverty</i>, deficient nutriment requiring the compensation
of alcohol. Horace seems to have combined
these notions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Ebrietas quid non designat? operta recludit<br />
Spes jubet esse ratas: in prælia trudit inertem,<br />
Sollicitis animis onus eximit: addocet artes.<br />
Fæcundi calices, quem non fecere disertum?<br />
Contracta quem non in paupertate solutum.<br />
</p>

<p>And to much the same effect, Ovid:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Vina parant animos, faciuntque coloribus aptos.<br />
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.<br />
Tunc veniunt risus, tunc pauper cornua sumit,<br />
Tunc dolor et curæ, rugaque frontis abit.<br />
Tunc aperit mentes, ævo rarissima nostro<br />
Simplicitas, artes excutiente Deo.<br />
</p>

<p>Others assign as the cause <i>depressing influences</i>. Thus
in the <i>Transactions of Association for Promoting Social
Science</i>, London, 1859, pp. 86-89, &lsquo;it is said that crime
is caused by drunkenness, and that (drunkenness) by
foul air and the depressing influence of bad localities,
bringing with it a fierce desire for stimulants, and by
bad and deficient water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poet Burns contributed not a little to the popular
notion that under such circumstances strong drink (particularly
the &lsquo;mountain dew&rsquo;) was the panacea:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Food fills the wame, an&rsquo; keeps us livin&rsquo;:<br />
Tho&rsquo; life&rsquo;s a gift no worth receivin&rsquo;,<br />
When heavy dragg&rsquo;d wi&rsquo; pine and grievin&rsquo;;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">But oil&rsquo;d by thee,</span><br />
The wheels o&rsquo; life gae down-hill scrievin&rsquo;,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Wi&rsquo; rattlin glee.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>Thou clears the head o&rsquo; doited lear;<br />
Thou cheers the heart o&rsquo; drooping care;<br />
Thou strings the nerves o&rsquo; labour sair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">At&rsquo;s weary toil;</span><br />
Thou even brightens dark despair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Wi&rsquo; gloomy smile.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Again, the <i>social usages of society</i> have a powerful
tendency to indulgence. Friendship and good cheer
seem indissolubly intertwined. Cups that cheer have
long been regarded as essential items. But it must be
set down as an unquestionable fact that in the higher
circles of society, far less is drunk than formerly. The
London clubs are a very fair index of the condition of
things existing within that sphere. In them, excess is
now practically unknown; at any rate in the more select
clubs. Their cellars teem with good wine now, as they
did half a century ago, when we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The value of the stores found in the cellars of the various Club-houses
in London, may be adduced in evidence of the estimation in
which wine is held, by a portion, at least, of the higher classes in
the metropolis. Carlton Club, 1,500<i>l.</i>; United University Club,
not much under 2,000<i>l.</i> The Literary and Scientific Athenæum,
3,500<i>l.</i> to 4,000<i>l.</i> The Union Club appears to exceed the rest in
the contents of its cellars, which remarks the writer, from whose
work we extract this information, &lsquo;disguise it as people will, is the
most important matter after all.&rsquo; The stock of wine (the Chairman
declares it to be an under-estimate) according to a recent valuation,
amounts to 7,150<i>l.</i> The Junior United Service Club values its
stock of wines at 3,722<i>l.</i> Those of the United Service Club are
worth, it is said, 7,722<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></div>

<p>But riot and rowdyism are things of the past.</p>

<p>Among the middle classes, many of the compulsory
drinking usages are swept away. In Mr. Dunlop&rsquo;s
interesting volume, no less than 297 of these <i>usages</i> are
specified as then rife.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> A much improved tone is observable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
amongst <i>commercial travellers</i> than some fifty years
ago, when the modern Ramazzini wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Well fed, riding from town to town, and walking to the houses
of the several tradesmen, they have an employment not only more
agreeable, but more conducive to health than almost any other
dependent on traffic. But they destroy their constitutions by
intemperance; not generally by drunkenness, but by taking more
liquor than nature requires. Dining at the traveller&rsquo;s table, each
drinks his pint or bottle of wine; he then takes negus or spirit with
several of his customers, and at night he must have a glass or two
of brandy and water. Few commercial travellers bear the employ
for thirty years&mdash;the majority not twenty.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p></div>

<p>And Mr. Samuelson, in his <i>History of Drink</i>, sees traces
of an improving tone amongst the operative classes; of
which, amongst other things, the dissociation of benefit
and other clubs from taverns, is an index.</p>

<p>There are fewer now to sneer at the efforts for a
moral regeneration. It may be doubted if Mr. Barham
would to-day gloat over his lines in the <i>Milkmaid&rsquo;s
Story</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Mr. David has since had a &lsquo;serious call,&rsquo;<br />
He never drinks ale, wine, or spirits, at all,<br />
And they say he is going to Exeter Hall<br />
To make a grand speech, and to preach, and to teach<br />
People that &lsquo;they can&rsquo;t brew their malt liquor too small.&rsquo;<br />
That an ancient Welsh Poet, one Pyndar ap Tudor,<br />
Was right in proclaiming &lsquo;Ariston men Udor!&rsquo;<br />
Which Means &lsquo;The pure Element is for Man&rsquo;s belly meant!&rsquo;<br />
And that <i>Gin&rsquo;s</i> but a <i>Snare</i> of Old Nick the deluder!<br />
</p>

<p>Some of the finest writers of our time have exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>their pen in describing the horrors of intemperance.
Charles Kingsley writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Go, scented Belgravians, and see what London is. Look!
there&rsquo;s not a soul down that yard, but&rsquo;s either beggar, drunkard,
thief, or worse. Write anent that! Say how ye saw the mouth o&rsquo;
Hell, and the twa pillars thereof at the entry&mdash;the Pawnbroker&rsquo;s
shop o&rsquo; one side, and the Gin-palace at the other&mdash;twa monstrous
deevils, eating up men and women and bairns, body and soul.
Look at the jaws o&rsquo; the monsters, how they open and open and
swallow in anither victim and anither. Write anent <i>that</i>!...
Are not they a mair damnable, man-devouring Idol than ony red-hot
statue of Moloch, or wicker Magog, wherein the auld Britons

hizzies, with their arms round the men&rsquo;s neck, and their mouths
full o&rsquo; vitriol and beastly words! Look at that Irishman pouring
the gin down the babbie&rsquo;s throat! Look at that rough of a boy

he stole the morning, into the ginshop, to buy beer poisoned
wi&rsquo; grains of paradise and cocculus indicus, and salt, and a&rsquo;

<p>Mr. Ruskin has said that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>drunkenness is not only the cause of crime, but that it <i>is</i> crime;
and that if any encourage drunkenness for the sake of the profit
derived from the sale of drink, they are guilty of a form of moral
assassination as criminal as any that has ever been practised by
the bravos of any country or of any age.</p></div>

<p>Even Carlyle could doff his mannerism to state his
conviction that gin is the most authentic incarnation of
the infernal principle that is yet discovered. Cobden
and Bright have hurled at the whole business their
unmeasured anathemas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>But probably no individual has done more, within
living memory, to educate and stimulate the national
conscience than the late George Cruikshank. From the
first (says Mr. Thompson Cooper)<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> he had shown a
strong tendency to administer reproof in his treatment
of intoxication and its accompanying vices. Instances
of this tendency are to be found in his <i>Sunday in London</i>,
<i>The Gin Trap</i>, <i>The Gin Juggernaut</i>, and more especially
in his series of eight prints entitled <i>The Bottle</i>; the
latter of which had eminent success, and was dramatised
at eight theatres in London at one time. It brought the
author into direct personal connection with the leaders
of the temperance movement. As he, moreover, became
a convert himself to their doctrines, he was one of the
ablest advocates of the temperance cause. Of late years,
Mr. Cruikshank turned his attention to oil-painting, a
branch of art in which he so far educated himself as to
make his pictures sought after by connoisseurs.</p>

<p>The great work by which this Hogarth of the nineteenth
century will be remembered in the present connection
is a large picture entitled <i>The Worship of Bacchus</i>,
which he exhibited to the Queen at Windsor in
1863. An engraving of this picture has been published
in which all the figures are outlined by the painter, and
finished by Mr. H. Mottram. The painting itself is now
the property of the nation.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In addition to individual endeavour, countless societies,
national, provincial, and local, have been formed
throughout the country to stem the evil; prominent
among these are the Church of England Temperance
Society, with her Majesty the Queen as patron, and the
entire bench of bishops with numerous other leaders of
society as its vice-presidents; the National Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
League; the United Kingdom Alliance; the United
Kingdom Band of Hope; the League of the Holy Cross,
with many other denominational societies; the Order
of Good Templars; the Rechabites; whilst the neophytes
of Blue Ribbonism are legion.</p>

<p>Further than these, every species of counter-attraction
is being furthered.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Education is made possible,
nay, compulsory, almost to all. Better dwellings are
being provided for the poor, and solid security for their
savings. Recreations are being provided for the masses;
and a vastly improved system of sanitation. The medical
world<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> is giving the subject its close attention, and as
the result of its labours of close observation and analysis,
the fallacies of a past and less scientific age are being
dethroned; and as a tangible outcome, temperance
hospitals and homes are being erected.</p>

<p>And whilst philanthropy is engaged in one direction
in reforming the drunkards, in another it is busy in
reforming the drinks. Thus, Mr. Edward Bradbury
writes in <i>Time</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If Sir Wilfrid Lawson, and his fervent followers, would accomplish
a substantial reform in the drinking habits of the United
Kingdom, let them turn their zeal to the villanous compounds
which audaciously counterfeit Scotch whiskey. Such spirits as are
issued from this ancient Oban Distillery conduce to &lsquo;good spirits.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>The influence of honest Scotch whiskey tends to joviality and
generosity, instead of violence and murder; to good temper and
amity instead of violence and blows. Bacchus by the ancients was
regarded as the god of harmony and reconciliation. There are
many poisonous pretenders to Scotch whiskey; and it is when
fusel-oil masquerades as pure spirit that the evil comes. The
licensed victualler who dispenses such abominable stuff ought to be
treated as one of the criminal classes. It is liquid lunacy, fluid
ferocity, distilled damnation, akin to that compound which Cassio
drank in Cyprus, of which</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;Every cup is unbless&rsquo;d, and the ingredient is a devil.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>Much of the drunkenness which disgraces our civilisation is due
to &lsquo;doctored&rsquo; drink. Alfred Tennyson was incensed by this reign
of adulteration when he wrote those impassioned lines in his poem
<i>Maud</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">
&lsquo;And the vitriol madness flushes up in the ruffian&rsquo;s brain,<br />
Till the filthy by-lane rings to the yell of the trampled wife,<br />
And chalk and alum and plaster are sold to the poor for bread,<br />
And the spirit of murder works in the very means of life.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>The quantity of &lsquo;vitriol madness&rsquo; which unprincipled dealers
push into the market, and which is sold cheaply to the unscrupulous
proprietors of garish dram-shops to be disposed of dearly enough to
deluded customers, is at once great and glaring. I wonder the
Temperance party do not use their earnestness in the cause of
reforming the drink, so that when the poor man wants whiskey he
gets it, and not turpentine and fusel-oil and amylic atrocities; or
when the doctor orders the sick woman port wine she is not imposed
upon by a fraudulent decoction of logwood. Our ancestors, wiser
in their generation, appointed &lsquo;ale-tasters,&rsquo; who did their duty
without fear or favour. Why cannot &lsquo;spirit-tasters&rsquo; be introduced
in our day? Or, why cannot whiskey come within the limits of
the Food Adulteration Act? The quantity of bad whiskey made
in Great Britain is amazing. To use the word &lsquo;whiskey&rsquo; is an
outrage of the term. &lsquo;Patent spirit&rsquo; is the Excise description for
this fluid, which is made by a special apparatus, known as the
Coffey Patent Still, from maize, rice, damaged barley, &amp;c. Malting
would be too costly, so this material is converted into starch and
saccharine by a process of vitriol. It is then passed through the
Coffey Still by only one process, and boiled by steam instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
fire. The patent spirit is ostensibly sold for blending purposes, and
for cheapening finer spirit. Some of these cheap whiskies are as
combustible as that Bourbon spirit of which a man once partook,
and found so inflammable that&mdash;blowing his nose directly afterwards&mdash;he
found his pocket-handkerchief in flames. Such whiskey,
they say in the States, kills dead at ten paces, and no human being
drinking it ever lives to pay his debts.</p></div>

<p>Still, intemperance, like a myriad-headed monster,
rears its hideous head, and the usual thirty millions
sterling in the shape of taxation rolls into the lap of the
reluctant Chancellor of the Exchequer. <i>Reluctant</i>, for
so they would have us understand their attitude towards
their gains from a nation&rsquo;s indulgence. A comparatively
recent Chancellor, Sir Stafford Northcote, in his budget
speech, 1874, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the reduction of the revenue derived from spirits be due to
other causes; if it should be due to a material and considerable
change in the habits of the people, and increasing habits of temperance
and abstinence from the use of ardent spirits, I venture to
say that the amount of wealth such a change would bring to the
nation would utterly throw into the shade the amount of revenue
that is now derived from the spirit duty.</p></div>

<p>Nearly a century ago, Sir Frederic Eden, in his <i>State
of the Poor</i>, observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For government to offer encouragement to ale-houses, is to act
the part of a <i>felo de se</i>. Nor ought the public ever to be lulled
into an acquiescence by the flattering bait of immediate gain,
which ere long they would be obliged to <i>pay back to paupers, in
relief, with a heavy interest</i>.</p></div>

<p>Half a century before, the historian Smollett (v. 15)
had remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>After all it must be owned that the good and salutary effects of
the prohibition were visible in every part of the kingdom, and no
evil consequence ensued <i>except a diminution of the revenue</i> in
this article [spirits], a consideration which ought at all times to be
sacrificed to the health and morals of the people.</p></div>

<p>And nearly half a century before Smollett, John
Disney (magistrate and divine) had written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I deny the assertion that the revenue of y<sup>e</sup> crown will really
be impaired by prohibiting tipling &amp; drunk<sup>ss</sup>.... 3 parts in 4
of the pore families in this kingdom have been reduced to want
chiefly by haunting Taverns or Ale-houses. Espec<sup>y</sup> labouring
men, who very often consume there on the Lord&rsquo;s day what
they have gotten all the week before, &amp; let their families beg or
steal for a subsistence the week foll<sup>g</sup>.... Now I suppose you will
grant me that as the No. of poor &amp; ruined families encreases in
a nation, the Prince that governs must find a proportionable decay
in his Revenue. On the other side, all such laws duly executed as
keep men by sobriety temp<sup>ce</sup> &amp; frugality in a thriving condition, do
most effectually provide for the happiness of the people &amp; for the
riches of the Prince.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p></div>

<p>But there are symptoms of a decline in this source
of revenue. A leading London daily paper has lately
thus adverted to this momentous menace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Official statistics go far to confirm the triumphant claim of
total abstainers that the consumption of strong drink is falling off
at a rate not distasteful to the philanthropist, but suggesting grave
reflection to a Chancellor of the Exchequer. The receipts from
beer, wines, and spirits have been estimated in all recent budgets at
nearly thirty millions sterling a year, if we add to the excise the
customs duties derived from foreign spirits; and, as this amount is
considerably more than a third of the entire revenue, any causes
that impair its growth or make it decline are of serious importance
to the nation. That the revenue from excise is not increasing, but
is actually falling behind, despite the change from a malt tax to a
beer duty, is indisputable. That temperance habits have made
prodigious strides in the last few years is also beyond question.
Do the two changes stand to each other in the relation of effect to
cause? In other words, is less of beer, spirits, wine consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>because there is a want of inclination, or is it from want of ability?
Partly from the latter influence, there is little doubt. Total abstinence
is popular with many because it is an aid to health; with
others because it is the handmaid of morality and thrift; self-denying
persons practise it because it sets an excellent example;
and multitudes like it as it is economical.... In so far, then, as
the need for retrenchment is one cause of reduced consumption of
strong drink, a change in habit and in fashion might be expected
to come with increased material prosperity. The nation &lsquo;drank
itself out of the Alabama difficulty&rsquo; in the exuberant days which
saw Mr. Lowe at the Exchequer; and it may yet again take to
tippling so heartily as to enable Mr. Childers to dispense with a
portion of the income-tax. At present, however, there is not the
faintest symptom of this; all the indications point in the other
direction. Temperance and total abstinence march from one
conquest to another, blessed by bishops, clergy, and even princes
of the Christian Churches, patronised by doctors, eulogised by hard-headed
men of business, and gathering in everywhere crowds of
enthusiastic converts. The movement is sweeping over the nation
in an unchecked tide, acquiring force as it goes, and inaugurating
not change merely, but social revolution.... Such changes,
needless to repeat, bode no good to the English Chancellor
Exchequer, who has to sit idly contemplating the gradual running
dry of more than one tributary rill, which he is at his wits&rsquo; end to
replenish from other sources, or to replace by a more reproductive
substitute. Perhaps it is too soon to moralise over the passing
event, but it will be impossible long to postpone action, and to rest
content with mere discussion. If the change we now witness is
going to be permanent, that is, if the crusade on behalf of abstinence
from strong drink is to proceed with redoubled success next
year, Mr. Childers will not only he unable to make any allowance
for an elastic growth of the excise receipts, but he will have to
prepare for a diminution.</p></div>

<p>Had the coming event cast its shadow before? Isaac
Disraeli long ago predicted a <i>return</i> to sobriety. We
shall probably (said he) outlive that custom of hard
drinking, which was so long one of our national vices.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>
<p>Everyone devoutly longs for such a <i>terminus ad quem</i>.
But <i>were</i> the former days really better than these? Could
we devoutly desire a <i>return</i> to any social era of the past?
A pre-Elizabethan dietetic millennium is a retrospective
mirage. It was a phantom of the historian Camden,
which the elder Disraeli, and others in his wake, have
endeavoured to stereotype. Granted, that nations, like
individuals, are imitators; granted, that the English
in their long wars in the Netherlands learnt to drown
themselves in immoderate drinking, and by drinking
others&rsquo; healths to impair their own; still it is <i>not</i>
true that in those wars they &lsquo;first&rsquo; learnt such excess,
and it is <i>not</i> true that &lsquo;of all the northern nations,
they had been before this most commended for their
sobriety.&rsquo; For at least one thousand years before the
Netherland wars, Britain had been stigmatised for intemperance.
Gildas had called attention in the sixth
century to the fact that laity and clergy slumbered away
their time in drunkenness.</p>

<p>S. Boniface (a native of Britain) in the eighth century
had written to Cuthbert respecting the vice of
drunkenness: &lsquo;This is an evil peculiar to pagans and
<i>our</i> race. Neither the Franks, nor the Gauls, nor the
Lombards, nor the Romans, nor the Greeks, commit it.&rsquo;
We have already noticed that the conquest of the English
by the Normans has been attributed especially to the
then prevailing habit of intemperance: that in the following
century John of Salisbury could write: &lsquo;Habits of
drinking have made the English famous among all foreign
nations.&rsquo; How then could the Elizabethan town-wit,
Tom Nash, write: &lsquo;Superfluity in drink is a sin that ever
since we have mixed ourselves with the Low Countries is
counted honourable; but before we knew their lingering
wars, was held in that highest degree of hatred that
might be&rsquo;?<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>
<p>No. It is a long story; and three centuries do not
compass it. But a better tone is beginning to prevail,
which augurs well for a time when abuse being buried in
the hansard dust of oblivion, man may not hesitate to
use the gifts which a gracious Father has given His
children to enjoy.</p>

clergy of his diocese, against drinking in remembrance of the dead,
which he published in pamphlet form. This was followed by a second
pamphlet, wherein he refuted charges that his critics had made, to the
effect that he was actuated by a spirit of hostility to the memory of
William III., it being well known that the Bishop was an extreme Tory,
and he had laid particular stress on the prevalent custom of drinking to
the &lsquo;Immortal Memory of William III.&rsquo; This again excited considerable
adverse criticism; and in 1716 Dr. Browne launched forth a somewhat
exhaustive <i>Discourse of Drinking Healths</i>. But though he handles
his theme very ably, the tract is no more than a concise epitome of the
arguments and authorities used by the Puritan writers of the previous
century. It has been stated that the bishop did not make many converts
by his brochures: that, on the contrary, the custom of drinking to
William&rsquo;s &lsquo;immortal memory&rsquo; increased, and that to the original form
of the toast was tacked on a scurrilous expression indicative of the
extreme contempt in which the author of the diatribes was held.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p></div>
